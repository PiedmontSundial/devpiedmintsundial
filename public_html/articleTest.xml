    <title>Maddie Wiener Penetrates Male Dominated Comedy Scene</title>
    <subhead>Teenager Shows Chops In Triangle Comedy Scene</subhead>
    <subheadTwo>PULLING UP STAKES FOR CHICAGO</subheadTwo>
    <body>&#xD;
		CARRBORO&#x2014;Stephen Jay Gould once said that he was less interested in Einstein himself than in the certainty that someplace else, there was someone with a brain equal to Einstein&#x2019;s languishing in a cotton field or a sweatshop.
	
	Comedy open mics bring to mind something similar; odds are that someone with the mind of an Andy Kaufman, Don Rickles or Richard Pryor is sweating under hot lights on a rickety stage somewhere in a town like Chapel Hill. They may be getting laughs, even killing. They work a day job then get up on stage. Then they leave out the same door as the club patrons, no recording, no CD, no HBO special.
	
	Maddie Wiener is a 19-year-old standup prodigy whose name is buzzing across the Triangle&#x2019;s comedy scene. Wiener is an anomaly. In spite of arguably being a little green (her first open mic was at DSI Comedy Club three years ago) she has developed a commanding stage presence that some comedy veterans never attain.
	
	At Cat&#x2019;s Cradle, a bespectacled, quiet-looking young woman walks on stage, grabs the mic, and begins her set by anguishing over which college she&#x2019;ll be accepted to. Thirty seconds later, she drops this gem: &#x201C;When I get sexually assaulted, I want it to at least make the news.&#x201D; A joke that could stop a clock instead sets the room ablaze with laughter. She owns the room for the remaining nine-and-a-half minutes.
	
	Her irreverent humor is alloyed with a streak of brazenness. &#x201C;If I held God to the same standard that I held any boyfriend,&#x201D; she told an audience at 2nd Wind in Carrboro, &#x201C;I would have broken up with him after the first flood. That&#x2019;s how people stay in abusive relationships. He&#x2019;s like &#x2018;I&#x2019;m not gonna do it again.' . . . He&#x2019;s gonna do it again!&#x201D;
	
	Though her humor is irreverent, her personality is not&#x2014;other comics despise authority almost by default. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m super super scared of authority. I wouldn&#x2019;t be telling rape jokes in casual conversation at work,&#x201D; she says. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m very agreeable. I think being a woman has something to do with it.&#x201D;
	
	James Hodge has been a comedian for ten years and has opened for Dave Chappelle, among others. He&#x2019;s worked with Bobcat Goldthwait, Marc Maron, Amy Schumer, Aziz Ansari, just to name a few. He had this to say about Maddie: &#x201C;She&#x2019;s extremely talented, one of the funniest young comics I&#x2019;ve ever seen. That&#x2019;s not an exaggeration for print, she&#x2019;s legit a monster-good comic.&#x201D;
	
	In a male-dominated field, she fits in. &#x201C;I&#x2019;ve always gotten along with guys better. I&#x2019;ve always ended up being the only girl in a group of guys, so it&#x2019;s not that weird to me. It&#x2019;s hard sometimes, because there&#x2019;s not a lot of other people like you doing the thing, so it&#x2019;s nice to have a community. . . . I&#x2019;d like to see more women doing comedy, but not just for the sake of doing it.&#x201D;
	
	Several things make her stand out from the mill of open-mic regulars, first of which being that she never set out to be a comic. &#x201C;I wasn&#x2019;t doing it to pursue comedy&#x201D;, Wiener said. &#x201C;It was a fun thing to do after school. I just kind of kept doing it. After a couple of months, I figured &#x2018;maybe I&#x2019;ll stick to this.&#x2019;&#x201D;
	
	Comics are sometimes quick to tell you about the profound effect that a Pryor or a Bill Hicks or George Carlin had on them. &#x201C;I did watch them,&#x201D; Wiener said. &#x201C;I watched Louis C.K. when I was younger. [He] was the big one I got into&#x2026;But I never thought about it as something I could do.&#x201D;
	
	She has no political or humanitarian agenda, she said recently, before her 19th birthday. &#x201C;No, I&#x2019;m just trying to be funny. I&#x2019;m 18, I don&#x2019;t really have a message I&#x2019;m trying to get across&#x2026;If I could make a living doing standup, I would be super super happy.&#x201D;
	
	Comics are stereotyped to be a self-destructive lot, just as clowns are deemed sad. They take to the stage like an agonal breath, and release inner demons there. Wiener doesn&#x2019;t quite fit the mold. &#x201C;There&#x2019;s definitely a lot of f--kups,&#x201D; she said, &#x201C;but ya know, I&#x2019;ve struggled with that kind of stuff myself. But so does everyone. There&#x2019;s a bunch of suicidal people [in comedy].&#x201D;
	
	It&#x2019;s a common saying that tragedy plus time equals comedy. Given the early deaths of Chris Farley, Sam Kinison, Lenny Bruce, Belushi, Mitch Hedberg and others, perhaps it is an inverse industry truism that comedy plus time equals tragedy. Live comedy is a pressure cooker. In a field where bombing onstage is referred to as &#x201C;dying,&#x201D; Wiener seems to carry herself in uncommonly healthy way.
	
	&#x201C;It&#x2019;s the most fun thing I&#x2019;ve ever done,&#x201D; she said, &#x201C;and I&#x2019;ve met my favorite people in the world from [doing comedy]. Now that I&#x2019;m doing it&#x2014;now, I&#x2019;m watching as much comedy as I can get my hands on. . . . You&#x2019;re just saying silly stuff, and some people do that for a living. That&#x2019;s crazy. It&#x2019;s insane that that&#x2019;s a job.&#x201D;
	
	She has an optimism that seems rare among gifted comics. &#x201C;You have to be really confident that in a room of people that they should pay money to hear what you have to say. . . Gender roles would not have women do that. I think part of it is, if a guy is onstage and is looking gross&#x2014;you have to be kind of gross to be funny, and women are taught to be attractive above all else. You&#x2019;re trying to make a living doing unladylike things. For as many people as have that opinion, I hear women say &#x2018;shit&#x2019; and &#x2018;c--t&#x2019; all the time.&#x201D;
	
	&#x201C;She&#x2019;s a natural writer with a quirky performance style that is abrasive and likeable at the same time,&#x201D; Hodge said. &#x201C;That&#x2019;s a rare and cool combo, especially in someone who is barely old enough to vote and still can&#x2019;t legally buy a wine cooler. Because she&#x2019;s so young, she has a fresh point of view nobody has ever heard before. It&#x2019;s cool to watch.&#x201D;
	
	Maddie Wiener is performing October 26 at the Local 506 in Chapel Hill.	</body>

    <title>Can they teach an old Bach new tricks?</title>
    <subhead>Timeless Goldberg Variations Get A Brand-New Twist</subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>Johann Sebastian Bach composed his &#x201C;Goldberg Variations,&#x201D; the works that pianist Emma Dinnerstein performed at Duke&#x2019;s Reynolds Industries Theater with dance choreographed by Pam Tanowitz at a premier last Friday, in 1741 while in the employ of Count Kaiserling of Saxony. Bach is supposed to have conceived it as a soothing aural tonic for the monarch&#x2019;s insomnia.
	
	Could the composer have known that his musical nightcap would relapse into the modern era as some of the most recognizable melodies in Western music? Without knowing the composer or origins, even the most pop-culture infused millennials could likely complete one or more of its musical phrases after hearing the first few notes.
	
	Watching Dinnerstein play piano cannot be far off from what it was like to see Jaco Pastorius dominate the bass or Charlie Parker exhale the universe though his saxophone. Her technical virtuosity cannot be overstated, and her personal style blends a warm resonance with playful phrasing which worked perfectly with the Tanowitz&#x2019; choreography. Perhaps the most unexpected delight of the evening was the costume design, the work of up-and-coming fashionistas Reid &amp; Harriet, which gave the whole production a dreamlike quality. Which is fitting, considering the work&#x2019;s hypnotic origins as a palliative for a sleepless central-European royals.
	
	The fruits of Tanowitz and Dinnerstein&#x2019;s combined creative energy held its two-night world premiere at Duke University&#x2019;s Reynold&#x2019;s Industries Theater, beginning with an evening of music and dance featuring Dinnerstein centerstage and seven seasoned modern dancers who recently had finished a week-long residency at Duke in anticipation of the event.
	
	Every generation, classical music encounters a pianist who at least tries to breath fresh life into the timeless work. Glenn Gould&#x2019;s recorded version in 1964 lent relevance to the genre for a generation of mid-century beatniks and hipsters by endowing it with some avant-garde, macho credibility. In 2006 a young Brooklyn-based Juilliard graduate struggling for a foothold in the New York classical scene, self-funded and produced an album that showcased her unique approach to each of the seventeen pieces that make up &#x201C;Goldberg; Dinnerstein&#x2019;s name was stamped into classical music.
	
	Dinnerstein&#x2019;s career took off immediately as her interpretation of Bach&#x2019;s variations received nearly universal praise for its seamless technique and ebullient phrasing. And, very unexpectedly, it briefly broke into the pop charts, outselling the White Stripes on Amazon.
	
	However, Dinnerstein isn&#x2019;t done yet, and she recently found a collaborator with whom to share her Bach obsession&#x2014;dancer and choreographer Pam Tanowitz, who, like Dinnerstein, is known for her moderns spins on well-trod forms, and she has worked extensively within both the ballet and modern idioms.
	
	Tanowitz is best known among dance aficionados for her 2012 original piece &#x201C;Untitled (Blue Ballet)&#x201D; which left critics icy, her career in limbo, and her emotions reportedly in the gutter; she rebounded in a big way the following year with &#x201C;The Spectators&#x201D; which featured scores by Dan Siegler and Annie Gosfield and a live performance by the legendary Flux Quartet..
	
	Bach&#x2019;s life and work are particularly important to historians of music, as they marked a transitional period when the Baroque era&#x2019;s tonal experiments became the standard form of European chamber music, and compositions written for secular settings began to gain popularity over the sacred and liturgical. Bach adapted his work to his changing times, and perhaps that is why it remains timeless in the way that the music of few others has, and why generations of keyboard musicians keep returning to his work.</body>

    <title>In 3CC, Matt Phillips Weaves a Community of Music</title>
    <subhead>Three Corners Collective thrives in Chapel Hill-Carrboro music culture </subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>CARRBORO&#x2014;Matt Phillips was performing at places like The Cave while still in high school. The legendary Chapel Hill club, subterranean ground-zero of rock in the Triangle for more than 30 years, was a strong place to start for a teenager like him. 
	
	But Phillips, in a telltale way for a kid who would start the musical cooperative known as Three Corners Collective, moved his music to the streets and began busking on Franklin Street.
	
	&#x201C;I decided to go to the streets because it was a form of democratic music,&#x201D; said Phillips. &#x201C;People get to vote with their dollar.&#x201D;
	
	Phillips moved to the Chapel Hill area when he was nine. By the time he was a student at Woods Charter School became the &#x201C;go-to man&#x201D; any time members the faculty needed to run sound equipment. These were the origins of the musician who, at 25 now, is the Chapel Hill-Carrboro music neighborhood&#x2019;s fixer, one to go to when you need sound, lighting, an event or a venue in the surrounding area.
	
	The story turned another corner three and a half years ago, when the young musician was given the opportunity to move his music from a street corner &#x201C;indoors&#x201D; to a regular venue again, with a recurring gig.  While busking he met the manager from Fitzgerald&#x2019;s, an Irish-themed college bar now defunct, who was impressed and invited him to play a three-hour set once a month.
	
	Phillips decided to split the time, inviting his also-talented friends to play as openers.  The crowd grew, Phillips was getting bigger shows around town, and Fitzgerald&#x2019;s asked him to start playing every Wednesday night.
	
	Phillips&#x2019;s manager advised he not play the weekly set, in order to maintain local interest in his other shows.  So he invited more friends to fill the Wednesday night, and Three Corners Collective (3CC) was born.
	
	MUTUAL AID
	
	The initial concept for 3CC was to be a &#x201C;Mutual Aid Organization,&#x201D; says Phillips. Young, budding musicians, full of talent and desire to perform, often struggle to break into a local market.  So the intent for the organization was to promote the connections between local artists, local venues, and local audiences.  Phillips and his friends wanted to create something bigger than themselves. They wanted to foster an element of inclusiveness and give opportunities to those who didn&#x2019;t have the established connections in the scene to find those opportunities on their own.
	
	Many artists look to a record label or production company in order to break into a market.  But to be a member of the collective, a musician must join the existing company, and are promoted as a part of it.  3CC seeks to create a different avenue to step up in the musical world.  It boasts a strongly connected, pre-existing social network within the music market, and shares the benefit of these connections with new artists, free of charge, and without having to be a &#x201C;member.&#x201D;  The organization is registered as an LLC, but all proceeds are funneled directly back into the local music market.
	
	The weekly shows at Fitzgerald&#x2019;s became a vibrant community of young talent.  It brought in artists with whom people were unfamiliar.  It also brought in artists that were already established in the local scene, giving them opportunity for new musical expression.  The guitarist from a band would come in to do a solo set.  Also, musicians with side projects could showcase those projects.
	
	Eventually 3CC grew.  They were booked out three months in advance when Fitzgerald&#x2019;s closed unexpectedly.  Scrambling to keep the traction they had gained, they did house and front-of-house shows at Local 506, and eventually landed at 2nd Wind in Carrboro, hosting the 3CC show every Wednesday from 9PM to midnight.
	
	Fitzgerald&#x2019;s had been the birthplace of an opportunity, but the people in the audience were generally from out of town, and building the audience side of the social network had been challenging.  Now anchored at 2nd Wind, a Carrboro bar frequented by locals and friends, the organization is rebuilding itself to even greater heights.
	
	Phillips just returned from a 53-show trip in Europe.
	
	&#x201C;It was a great trip,&#x201D; said Phillips. &#x201C;I went to England, Germany, Austria, Belgium and the Netherlands. And now it is back to work.&#x201D;
	
	BRANCHING OUT
	
	Among the other strings he pulls as a musical fixer about town, Phillips is social media manager at two of Carrboro&#x2019;s and Chapel Hill&#x2019;s respective top music bookers, 2nd Wind and Local 506. 
	
	It&#x2019;s a great time to be a musician in the Triangle, and 3CC is branching out.
	
	&#x201C;Now we are in the process of taking each branch of 3CC and turning it into a business,&#x201D; Phillips said. We are looking at a record label, sound production company and an internet marketing company.&#x201D;
	
	Besides the ability to get things done, success seems to also be based on their friendly laid back approach to their clients.
	
	Phillips and staff members Trevor Overman, Brendan Macie, Gabriel Reynolds and Sarah DeWeese have created a comfortable and non cut throat atmosphere that literally makes the musicians feel at home and among friends.
	
	&#x201C;The goal for me as the owner of the business was for us to be the cool bosses,&#x201D; said Phillips. &#x201C;We want people to feel welcome, comfortable, and proud of their work.
	
	&#x201C;Together we are stronger,&#x201D; Phillips added. &#x201C;We have more bargaining power as a group.&#x201D;</body>

    <title>Town Dims Halloween on Franklin</title>
    <subhead>Does Holiday Streetfest Scare Town of Chapel Hill?</subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>CHAPEL HILL&#x2014;For years, Franklin Street has hosted a Halloween party of proportions approaching or exceeding victory celebrations over the Duke basketball team. The fall tradition in Chapel Hill has become as time-honored as beating Duke in the spring.
	
	At one time, Halloween on Franklin Street enjoined 80,000 people in a street party famous for the wildly creative costumes of its revelers. Through the public efforts of the town to quell the celebration, the Halloween crowd on Franklin Street last year was less than half as big. 
	
	In recent years, the Town of Chapel Hill has tried to shrink Halloween on Franklin and minimize its tourist appeal. Town officials offered a hopeful estimate of 20,000 for the upcoming holiday, which falls on Tuesday.
	
	&#x201C;Halloween in Chapel Hill is not a promoted event; it is a community safety response to a large crowd gathering on Franklin Street,&#x201D; reads a public bulletin from Chapel Hill Town Hall about this year&#x2019;s celebration. 
	
	&#x201C;We&#x2019;re not telling residents from outside Chapel Hill that they can&#x2019;t come, but we are asking people to respect that this is a Chapel Hill thing,&#x201D; said Ran Northam, the Community Safety Communications Specialist for the Town of Chapel Hill.
	
	Public messaging from recent years shows that the town&#x2019;s stance on Halloween on Franklin Street has been that of response to an externality. 
	
	If  the pattern of recent Halloweens holds on Tuesday, police will form a tight marching phalanx that may also include a motorcycle fleet before 11PM and begin clearing the street of people from east to west. People will be told to go into bars or businesses and not to be on the street or sidewalks unless they are going somewhere.
	
	 &#x201C;It really is a sea of people, when it gets really large. People have said that, and it really is like being in the ocean,&#x201D; said Northam, who has helped to coordinate the Town&#x2019;s efforts for the past three years. &#x201C;We expect it to be about 20,000 this year.&#x201D;
	
	This year&#x2019;s preliminary crowd estimate is based on the observations from last year, and based on the fact that this year Halloween will again fall on a weekday, Northam said. 
	
	A spirit of bacchanal pervades on the night of All Hallows&#x2019; Eve, and a street crowd in masquerade poses a unique challenge for law enforcement, a challenge Chapel Hill Police and their assisting agencies seem increasingly poised to meet with a response commensurate with controlling  a riot. 
	
	This year, the town has requested assistance from a dozen outside law enforcement agencies. Street closures, off-site parking and DUI checkpoints are sidelights to the crowd of thousands that will promenade Franklin Street in costume. Franklin Street will be flooded with halogen from portable lighting towers much brighter than the streetlight illumination.
	
	More than 200 officers will be in downtown Chapel Hill, including 100 from the Town, and also officers from Carrboro, Campus Police, and officers from Raleigh, Hillsborough, and Burlington. Fire Department staff and EMS are also on alert. Most calls to police are alcohol-related, said Northam. 
	
	Although there was a spike in alcohol-related mishaps in 2014, that holiday fell on a Friday. &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t think we had any arrests for Halloween last year. It usually stays pretty calm,&#x201D; Northam said.
	
	CROWD CONTROL
	
	When the Tar Heel Men&#x2019;s Basketball team won the NCAA National Championship this year, it&#x2019;s estimated that 55,000 fans took to Franklin Street. No major crimes were reported that night, and the jubilant crowd that burned couches and climbed telephone poles at the corners of Franklin and Columbia streets constrained its behavior from outright criminality; when you win a college championship in Chapel Hill, the heart of ACC country, some rules of civil decorum undergo temporary levitation. 
	
	The fire department cleared huddles of fire-jumpers away from inflamed debris, and 
	
	Chapel Hill police were on hand to keep order should things spill outside the margins of chaos. Every Franklin Street rush is approached as a potential crowd-control problem for police, and for a town its size Chapel Hill&#x2019;s police are forcefully equipped and well trained in the street control of large crowds. 
	
	Managing crowds on Franklin Street is a burden that Chapel Hill civic enforcement will able to shuck the last time the University of North Carolina wins a game in the Sweet 16 or beats Duke.
	
	Fortunately, it&#x2019;s a responsibility that Chapel Hill Police and their assisting agencies are prepared to address after years of putting into practice real-time crowd dispersement exercises that officers in other, larger towns might not even drill for.
	
	The Chapel Hill Police Department's most recent brush with crowd control took place on Aug. 22 during a protest against Silent Sam, the monument to the university's Civil War dead. Angry people mobbed a van carrying a protestor who had been arrested for putting on a mask.
	
	Protestors objected to the man's arrest and to the fact that the monument was guarded by a cordon of officers behind parade fencing. The crowd put officers at the center of a situation that looked like it could spin out of control. 
	
	Officers escorting the van on foot did not react with violence as protestors tried to impede the van's progress down Henderson Street. They did not respond to the taunts and physical press of some of those who followed the van, in a show of cool that helped to prevent a tense situation from devolving into street violence between protestors and police.
	
	On Oct. 1, a more becalmed crowd took to West Franklin Street for the Festifall Arts Festival free outdoor market.
	
	ON FRANKLIN STREET, BIG NIGHTS &#x201C;MAKE-OR-BREAK&#x201D; 
	
	The crowd-control discussion has a paper trail going back through many town administrations, and the decisions it has generated have touched the public in ways commercially tangible. 
	
	Merchants on Franklin Street, it was recently reiterated before a meeting of the Friends of the Downtown by a Franklin Street restaurateur, live or die by big weekends in Chapel Hill. The health of the retail corridor is measurable in the size and recurrence of crowds that swell on Franklin Street.
	
	On Tuesday, bars, pizza and ice cream parlors, baked goods shops, and more will staff up and brace for a crush of business.
	
	More than one Franklin Street bar owner has said they like police-squad push to &#x201C;get indoors&#x201D; at 11PM because it drives people inside to drink. Most bars staff an extra at the door to count people and enforce a &#x201C;one-out-one-in&#x201D; policy to stay at their occupancy limit.
	
	Statistics provided for this article show the Halloween crowd estimates peaked at around 80,000 people a decade ago. In 2015, that figure was at 40,000. Last year&#x2019;s crowd was estimated at 25,000.
	
	The reduction in Halloween Night crowd sizes in recent years has been part of a Town-sponsored effort called &#x201C;Homegrown Halloween,&#x201D; which began in 2008. Its stated initiative is to keep Halloween on Franklin a local event and to discourage it as a destination for out-of-towners.
	
	Street festivals on Franklin have incurred this kind of snuffing before. In 2006, the town admitted its inability to control the Apple Chill festival&#x2019;s late-night &#x201C;After Chill&#x201D; revelry among biker clubs that made the event an ad-hoc rally, after successive years marked by violence. 
	
	2006 was the last year the town experienced Apple Chill&#x2019;s spring-season &#x201C;boom day&#x201D; for downtown commercial activity, a gathering that had drawn midcoast pleasure seekers for 30 years.
	
	On Tuesday, East Franklin Street will closed to traffic from 8PM to 10:30PM, including the intersection at Columbia Street. 
	
	Vehicles stopping to unload passengers are prohibited, as are taxis, Uber vehicles and charter buses, which contributed to previous years&#x2019; crowd volumes as people bused in from around the state. 
	
	The town&#x2019;s bulletin on the Halloween response quoted town manager Roger Stancil: &#x201C;We are in this together &#x2013; Town, University, students, businesses and residents &#x2013; in support of our community and its many visitors.&#x201D;
	
	UNIVERSITY MEMORIES
	
	Mel Fos is a senior at UNC, and save for one year when she was sick, has been on Franklin Street every year for Halloween. &#x201C;It was actually low-key both times. I pretty much just went out to see other peoples&#x2019; creative costumes...and I just want to do the same this year,&#x201D; she said. 
	
	She spent one Halloween in the hospital for a kidney ailment, and she noted that UNC Memorial Hospital was &#x201C;absolutely packed with drunk students.&#x201D; 
	
	The Franklin Street celebration isn&#x2019;t restricted to UNC students or Chapel Hill residents. Bridgette Macapagal, 28, is an NC State grad taking post-graduate courses at Durham Tech. She went twice to Franklin Street during college and once since, though she&#x2019;s on the fence about going this year. 
	
	&#x201C;It was crazy,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;People were just&#x2026;out in the streets, lot of college kids, not sober. Everybody&#x2019;s having a good time, taking pictures with each other. You always see some creative costumes.&#x201D; She fondly recalled one of her friends making a functioning Transformers outfit out of cardboard boxes. 
	
	In spite of the crowd, Bridgette was never concerned. She said wistfully, &#x201C;It was always fun, I miss those days.&#x201D; 
	
	Time has shown Chapel Hill&#x2019;s  &#x201C;Homegrown Halloween&#x201D; initiative to be a success, in that the event has shrunk by three-fourths. If the event remains a wild and wooly burlesque, the point of Halloween is, once a year, to go out and raise some "hell."
	
	If you go to Halloween on Franklin Street, the Town of Chapel Hill has published a list of these prohibited items:
	
	&#x2022;	Unlicensed drones 
	
	&#x2022;	Costume accessories that look like weapons
	
	&#x2022;	Weapons
	
	&#x2022;	Alcoholic beverages
	
	&#x2022;	Glass bottles
	
	&#x2022;	Paint
	
	&#x2022;	Fireworks and explosives
	
	&#x2022;	Flammable substances
	
	&#x2022;	Animals
	
	&#x2022;	Coolers</body>

    <body>CARRBORO&#x2014;This is Barry Keith&#x2019;s 30th Halloween as proprietor of Surplus Sid&#x2019;s, located at 309 East Main Street in Carrboro. His store is a couple hundred yards from the head of West Franklin Street in Chapel Hill, home to one of the Atlantic coast&#x2019;s biggest and oldest Halloween street parties.
	
	&#x201C;There&#x2019;s no other way to describe Halloween, &#x2019;cept as being the one totally self-indulgent holiday, y'know?&#x201D; Keith says. Every year, the surplus store contributes to Franklin Street's wild menagerie at the end of October.
	
	Surplus Sid&#x2019;s has become a target zone for Halloween costumers hunting for creative Halloween garb. Every year, they flock to Sid&#x2019;s to size up the trimmings for the prize-winning idea.
	
	&#x201C;Two constants I&#x2019;ve always noticed,&#x201D; Keith says; &#x201C;If [a young lady] wants to be a bunch of grapes, if she just wants a purple leotard and a bunch of balloons done up, she wants to be a slightly sexy bunch of grapes.&#x201D;
	
	The men, Keith said, traditionally, have little idea of what to wear past wanting &#x201C;Sid&#x201D; to help them attract the anthropomorphized fruit women. It&#x2019;s been this way for thirty years.
	
	One customer claimed Sid could build a costume out of lint.
	
	&#x201C;We&#x2019;ve become grand masters of putting them spot-on into what they want to be,&#x201D; Keith said. &#x201C;The height of being creative, that&#x2019;s the fun part of it.&#x201D;
	
	Most people who come into the store call him Sid. He surveys Main Street as it passes by and enjoys talking history with his patrons. He looks the part of a military surplus store owner, with a burly mien and full reddish beard.
	
	What can you find at Surplus Sid&#x2019;s? Almost anything, and some of everything. Wigs and weaves, masks, hats, helmets and props of any sort. Also military surplus, old maps and medals, bags and dunnage issued by various armed forces around the world. He&#x2019;ll show you old curios. Ernie Pyle&#x2019;s typewriter? The chair Jackie Gleason perched upon as Minnesota Fats in &#x201C;The Hustler&#x201D;? Believe it or not, they&#x2019;ve been offered for sale at Surplus Sid&#x2019;s.
	
	This Halloween, Keith is as busy as ever. The &#x201C;Homegrown&#x201D; bit of what the Town of Chapel Hill seems to be going for in its Halloween campaign is reflected in the consistency of his Halloween business and the personality he brings to his job. Sid&#x2019;s and &#x201C;Sid&#x201D; are a part of Carrboro.
	
	&#x201C;I&#x2019;ve had people that have gotten costumes from me fifteen years ago,&#x201D; Keith said. &#x201C;I still see them on Franklin Street wearing the same costume.&#x201D;
	
	His favorites are the double entendres. One lady, Sid recalls, entered his shop a few years ago and told him she wanted to be a &#x201C;stud finder.&#x201D; Sid fixed her up with a construction worker outfit, leather tool belt, and an ad hoc device hanging around her neck with a remote-activated red beam that she could light up. His passion is in taking peoples&#x2019; ideas and bringing them to life, with good conversation and while making them laugh.
	
	Mel Fos, a senior at UNC Chapel Hill, tends to DIY her costumes, so she knows Surplus Sid&#x2019;s pretty well. &#x201C;He&#x2019;s definitely super nice and was always friendly,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;He&#x2019;s very easy to have conversations with, and he definitely is happy about what he does. I used to talk to him all the time when I frequented all the Carrboro shops.&#x201D;
	
	She was happy to hear Sid has been at it as long as he has been. Mel will be dressing up as Cruella de Vil this year, and her boyfriend will be a Dalmatian on a leash.
	
	Asked what he&#x2019;s going to be for Halloween, "Sid" chuckled and said, &#x201C;Exhausted, that&#x2019;s what I&#x2019;m gonna be.&#x201D; Keith is going to spend part of the evening at home with his wife, and perhaps, he said, part of the evening on Franklin watching the fun once he closes up on Halloween day.</body>

    <title>All Soul&#x2019;s Day: &#x201C;Remembering&#x201D; Gimghoul&#x2019;s Legendary Prodigal </title>
    <subhead>The story of Peter Dromgoole is bookended by mystery&#xD;
</subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>CHAPEL HILL&#x2014;On this day of the Dead, and for those who seek a post-Halloween haunting, there is a place to walk-off that Franklin Street hangover&#x2014;Hippol Castle, called Gimghoul.  
	
	A few steps from UNC campus and bound forever with university myth, the stone structure is a sourcepoint of mystery and lore not unaided by the secret society that built it. 
	
	Of the Order of Gimghoul, much is speculated and little known publically. As for the castle, it was built in 1924 by the order, which to finance construction sold land nearby that became the surrounding neighborhood on Gimghoul Road. 
	
	One peculiarity worth mentioning is the almost operatic melodrama behind the landmark&#x2019;s real-life namesake.  
	
	On April 3rd, 1877, the Raleigh Weekly Observer newspaper published an unattributed piece that purported to detail the mysterious disappearance of Peter Dromgoole about forty years earlier.  
	
	Son of a prosperous Virginia family, Peter came to Chapel Hill with every prospect, and essayed to enroll in the university. Peter was described as &#x201C;a wild, though bright youth, and many were his conflicts with the Faculty.&#x201D;
	
	His upbringing in a prominent family of ministers and politicians may have shielded him from the consequences of his outrageous and insubordinate behavior, but personal connections can only be stretched so far before tiresome antics are seen as a threat to one&#x2019;s good name. 
	
	&#x201C;He was ever bent on disturbing the peace of his venerable instructors,&#x201D; the article read, though university archives seem to discredit any notion that Dromgoole was enrolled.
	
	When a professor sent a letter to Peter&#x2019;s father, a Methodist minister and doctor, begging him to remove his son from campus, the patriarch was none too happy.  
	
	 &#x201C;The boy was ordered home&#x2014;no one ever thought he would go, for he had said he would not and never did he go.&#x201D;
	
	According to &#x201C;accepted&#x201D; legend, he may (or may not) have been killed in a duel with a Mississippian over the honor of a young lady. 
	
	Peter Dromgoole may have lived, but was never admitted to the University of North Carolina, records show. 
	
	Relevant documents of the time, including official and personal correspondence, indicate that Peter failed his entrance exam, and was studying with a private tutor so that he might matriculate that summer.  
	
	In his final letter to his father Peter made it known that his intentions were to sail to Europe; any specific incident which pushed him over the edge remains uncovered.    
	
	What happened next is disputed, to put it lightly.  The short version is that young Peter vanished from his Chapel Hill room leaving behind few if any personal articles and great deal of speculation.  Within twenty years of his last known sighting, a dubious legend grew.  
	
	As it is told now, Peter crossed pistols in a duel with a young man from Mississippi in a chivalrous dispute over a young woman, was subsequently killed in a duel, and then was buried in an unmarked grave in a campus neighborhood formerly known as Piney Prospect, but now marked on maps as Gimghoul. 
	
	Even more fantastic than the story of Peter Dromgoole might be notion that such a fabulous person actually existed and is not  character of invention, a Barry Lyndon for the Old North State.
	
	And yet he did. Periodicals provide ample record to back up the myth of Dromgoole. It is established that he was born in Halifax County of Irish ancestry. E. T. Malone, Jr. writes, &#x201C;His father was Edward Dromgoole II, a Methodist minister, physician, merchant, and planter; his mother was Sarah Creese Pelham. Congressman George C. Dromgoole (1797&#x2013;1847) of Virginia was his uncle.&#x201D; 
	
	Some researchers who have examined the case are convinced that the duel did not take place.  
	
	&#x201C;There is no evidence that he was killed,&#x201D; said UNC archivist Nicholas Graham. &#x201C;I think what most people assume was that he went west to make a new life for himself.  It&#x2019;s a true mystery.&#x201D;
	
	In 1889, The Order of Gimghoul was founded as a student club modeled after collegiate secret societies like Yale&#x2019;s Skull and Bones, and does not participate in traditional rush week activities. 
	
	&#x201C;It wasn&#x2019;t unusual to have these secret societies at the time,&#x201D; Graham said. &#x201C;If you look through the old yearbooks, there were a lot of them. . . but I&#x2019;ve never heard of them being involved in any sort of public controversy.&#x201D;  
	
	As with many organizations committed to clandestinity, shady rumors have swirled around The Order for decades.  Its presumed demographic of white males of privilege has helped to fuel the scandalmongering; but Graham says that any salacious stories you may have heard over the years are urban myths.  
	
	The Dromgoole legend may be grim or gothic, and the name Gimghoul may have a poetic resonance with high weirdness, but for generations Chapel Hill has looked upon Gimghoul Castle is as a local quirk and not something to fear.  
	
	&#x201C;Since that time many have been the attempts made to find the grave, and as many have been the failures,&#x201D; the Raleigh Weekly Observer article concludes. &#x201C;A gloom still hangs around the spot, and wild as ever is the scene with its low, thickly branched pines and the wind passing through them ever to morn, while the old oak, which stands near by, is the same constant watcher over the grave of Peter Dromgoole.&#x201D;
	
	Legends and ghost stories surrounding Dromgoole and Gimghoul involve a bloodstained rock where the wounded Peter lay dying. 
	
	There is another legend, affirmed by Chapel Hill locals who attest that if on a hot summer night one sneaks around the castle bearing a six-pack of beer, there is a stony perch a few hundred feet away from Gimghoul where one can sip beer in peace watching lights in the east come on while the sun sets behind you.
	
	Charley Mann, the creator of the website and blog Chapel Hill Memories, grew up in Chapel Hill in the early 1960&#x2019;s and told the Sundial that Gimghoul was &#x201C;a great place to bring a date.&#x201D;
	
	Or go camping with  a pet. &#x201C;I often camped in the woods below it with just a sleeping bag and my dog.&#x201D;  
	
	Mann personally knew members of The Order and thinks upon the grim castle with fondness. &#x201C;Chapel Hill was full of amazing people and events that today sound too incredible to believe - and in almost all cases I am talking about they were truly wonderful things,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;Very, very little that was dark.&#x201D;</body>

    <title>Davie Poplar Explosion Injured UNC Physics Professor</title>
    <subhead>Prof. Dan Reichart, a distingushed astronomer, suffered burns</subhead>
    <subheadTwo>Parts of Carrboro Cleared As Suspect's Car Searched For Bomb </subheadTwo>
    <body>&#xD;
		&#xD;
		&#xD;
		&#xD;
			CHAPEL HILL&#x2014;A small fire and explosion took place on the University of North Carolina campus at approximately 3:30 Thursday afternoon. 
	
	Physics professor Dan Reichart was injured in the blast. Chapel Hill Police have a suspect in custody. 
	
	The fire and explosion happened under Davie Poplar, iconic 375-year-old tree that is steeped in university history and traditions. The tree was scorched but did not appear significantly damaged. 
	
	Reports and an eyewitness video indicate that a young white male left a backpack and a guitar at the base of the Davie Poplar, an ancient tree leaning from age, located between McCorkle Place and the Old Well. 
	
	The man reportedly ignited the backpack, which later exploded and injured physics professor Dan Reichart, a distinguished astronomer who is director of the SkyNet Robotic Telescope Network. 
	
	Dr. Reichart was well enough Thursday evening to respond to questions via email. 
	
	&#x201C;I was walking across McCorkle Place and saw a fire at the base of the Davie Poplar,&#x201D; said Dr. Reichart, who spoke via email with The Sundial.  &#x201C;I didn't see who started it, just that it was there and starting to work its way up the tree&#x2026;and I didn't think this one was too big to kick out.  I tried but it grew very quickly, and then it exploded.&#x201D;
	
	Cell phone footage posted to social media shows a man attempting to stamp out the flame, when the bag suddenly explodes in a fireball throwing him back several feet. 
	
	Reichart estimates after seeing the video that he was thrown more than 20 feet, and he&#x2019;s grateful to bystanders who rushed to his aid until first responders arrived. &#x201C;The explosion blew out most of the fire, which probably saved the tree,&#x201D; Reichart said.
	
	It&#x2019;s unclear what specifically caused the explosion. &#x201C;It was an improvised explosive device of some type,&#x201D; Reichart said. &#x201C;Given how close I was, I guess I&#x2019;m pretty lucky.&#x201D;
	
	Dr. Reichart is currently being treated at UNC Hospital for first and second degree burns to his face and arms, and may require a skin graft. &#x201C;I hope to be back in the classroom sometime next week,&#x201D; Reichart said. 
	
	Will Freeman, a UNC senior, witnessed the aftermath of the explosion. Some reported that the suspect was yelling something about the devil. 
	
	&#x201C;I never heard [him say] &#x2018;Satan&#x2019;,&#x201D; said Freeman. &#x201C;But he was spouting crazy things, and I would not be surprised. It all seemed like a massive publicity stunt of a deranged individual, but I didn&#x2019;t interact with him all that much.&#x201D;
	
	Freeman said the suspect wasn&#x2019;t present when the explosion took place. &#x201C;No, he was long gone. The explosion was very unforeseen. I believe that it wasn&#x2019;t a device used. I think it was most likely the accelerant used to start the fire that eventually caught as it raged on. The man didn&#x2019;t seem like he was trying to bomb the school or commit an act of terror.&#x201D;
	
	Campus police arrived after the explosion and arrested the suspect, whose motivation remains unclear. A report has not yet been completed, and the suspect&#x2019;s name has not yet been released. 
	
	Shortly after the explosion, campus police contacted the Carrboro Police Department requesting that they investigate the suspect&#x2019;s vehicle, which was located on Weaver Street across from PNC Bank. 
	
	Carrboro Police Department tweeted at 4:17 PM: &#x201C;Suspicious package in area of W Weaver/Lindsay. Please avoid the area including side streets. If you&#x2019;re in area, please leave safely.&#x201D;
	
	&#x201C;UNC called us and said they got some information about this vehicle,&#x201D; said Captain Chris Atack of the Carrboro Police Department. &#x201C;As a result of the information that got passed on, we determined that there could be a hazard. So, we started that process by initially evacuating areas and trying to make a determination&#x2026;&#x201D;
	
	Officers shut down a roughly 300-foot radius around the vehicle, and with the aid of the Durham County Sheriff&#x2019;s Department&#x2019;s bomb squad used a robot to search the vehicle, though nothing of note was found.  
	
	&#x201C;Around 3:30 or 4:00 a police officer came in and told us to evacuate,&#x201D; said Dylan Turner who was working at The Music Loft on West Main Street. &#x201C;They did not give a specific time frame, so we closed early for our patrons and staff. They evacuated the whole building and others around it.&#x201D;
	
	In addition to Carrboro police, Orange County fire, EMS and Public Works were on site until shortly after 8PM when the roads were reopened, except for Weaver Street, which remained closed for some time thereafter. 
	
	The Piedmont Sundial reached out to Campus Police, and inquiries were directed to the Alert Carolina website. &#xD;

    <title>Guardsmen In Puerto Rico To Heal Maria&#x2019;s Wounds</title>
    <subhead>Storm Devastated U.S. Territory In September</subhead>
    <subheadTwo>Crisis Conditions Still Prevail</subheadTwo>
    <body>RALEIGH &#x2013; North Carolina National Guard members deployed to Puerto Rico may stay on the island through the end of November to help residents struggling through what has been described as a humanitarian crisis.
	
	On September 20, Hurricane Maria drove right through the middle of Puerto Rico. A Category 4 storm flooded San Juan, the U.S. territory&#x2019;s capital, and laid waste to the interior of the island.
	
	The island of 3.4 million Americans received a catastrophic level of damage. Over vast parts of the territory, people were without power, cell phone service, food or clean water; hospitals were running off generators.
	
	&#x201C;The 105th [Engineer Battalion] was originally sent for a month, but it has been extended until the end of November,&#x201D; said Captain Matthew Boyle of the National Guard's Office of Public Affairs. &#x201C;It could very easily be extended again.&#x201D;
	
	On the skirts of Hurricane Harvey, which inundated the Texas gulf coast in late August, people in the continental U.S. watched the events in Puerto Rico unfold on the news. Word of devastation trickled back as major communication networks were knocked out.
	
	Farms were decimated, airlines had waiting lists of over 20,000, and the economy was in shambles as the island faced a major health crisis.
	
	As some began finding ways to send support, and President Trump commented on the island&#x2019;s debt and inaccessibility, the North Carolina National Guard collected supplies and sent troops to contribute to the relief and humanitarian aid in Puerto Rico.
	
	&#x201C;We sent 160 personnel from our 105th Engineer Battalion,&#x201D; said Boyle.
	
	They brought food and water, and hit the ground running. &#x201C;We brought generators, giant cranes and tractors, and started assessing bridges and roads,&#x201D; Boyle said. &#x201C;We are doing debris removal, supply route clearing, road repairs, route reconnaissance and engineer assessments.&#x201D;
	
	They also brought a mobile kitchen and &#x201C;a bunch of water buffaloes.&#x201D; That&#x2019;s a 400-gallon water tank on a trailer.
	
	The North Carolina National Guard does this on a regular basis. &#x201C;In the hurricane season, we had people at every hurricane,&#x201D; Boyle said. &#x201C;We were at Irma, Harvey and now Maria.&#x201D;
	
	There are still many residents without running water and electricity, and locals wait many hours in line for food and water.
	
	Kathy Pratt lives in La Parguera and was hit with weeks of no water, phone coverage or electricity. She now has all three. &#x201C;We are in the southwestern part of the island, and only had 100 miles-per-hour wind,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;The northern area is really bad.&#x201D;
	
	La Parguera residents had to work things out on their own for the most part, she said.
	
	&#x201C;Where I am, only local people are doing the clean-up,&#x201D; said Pratt. &#x201C;I have only seen maybe three FEMA people, with most aid coming from local churches.&#x201D;
	
	The more devastated areas like Ponce have roads that are too narrow for large vehicles, so the troops are distributing the food and water by foot. Each family receives one box of MREs [Meal-Ready-to-Eat or military food rations] and a case of water during each distribution mission.
	
	As the troops arrived, they met with local leaders like Guayanilla mayor Erin Graham to find the specific needs in each community.
	
	Besides damaging roads and bridges, debris from Hurricane Maria is causing flooding and other serious issues as it blocks culverts across Puerto Rico. Washed-away roads and landslides have caused families to be stranded on the other side. Eventually, locals were using wooden structures built across washed-out sections in order to drive in and out.
	
	According to the National Guard, the damage to the island continues to worsen as residents experience additional rainfall.
	
	&#x201C;Debris in this area of Adjuntas has blocked the culvert, which causes the road to flood after any heavy rain,&#x201D; the National Guard stated in a news release. &#x201C;The water works its way underneath the road to further degrade any support, making this road impassible by motor vehicle.&#x201D;
	
	According to the National Center for Atmospheric Research, Hurricane Maria was &#x201C;like a 50-to-60-mile-wide tornado that made a direct hit on Puerto Rico.&#x201D; NOAA&#x2019;s release added that the island was already clipped by Category 5 Hurricane Irma, which left over a million people without power.
	
	Family members, individuals and tourists who visit Puerto Rico on a regular basis are just now starting to hear from the people they know on the island.
	
	Virgil Mehalek splits his vacation time between Chapel Hill visiting family and a home he and his immediate family stays in once a year in Rincon, Puerto Rico. They rent it from locals and are on friendly terms with them, neighbors and people in the little town.
	
	&#x201C;We had only been texting but I talked to the people we rent from last Thursday,&#x201D; said Mehalek. &#x201C;They now have power and water, and the local grocery store, The Econo, is open. Local restaurants are starting to open, and there have been a few tourists back. Most of the roads in the area have been cleared, and people are now able to drive to town.&#x201D;
	
	Rincon, like La Parguero, was spared the bulk of the damage, but the economic impact will remain as a slow-healing scar on the communities.
	
	&#x201C;I was told that all the renters have canceled, but that they [the owners] will be ready again by the new year,&#x201D; said Mehalek.
	
	This is great news for the less-impacted areas of Puerto Rico, but they will have to recover from four months without vacationers&#x2019; money flowing into their local economy. Elsewhere, the northern part of the island is still struggling to meet basic needs, and the NC National Guard, FEMA, and volunteers are working tirelessly to help. So is Kathy Pratt.
	
	She had moved to Carrboro to be near her daughter and grandchildren, but missed home and moved back to Puerto Rico.
	
	&#x201C;I had only gone eight days without water, but was OK because I had filled my bathtub,&#x201D; Pratt said. &#x201C;I have been helping out however I can. I go out and hand out boxes of supplies.&#x201D;
	
	With troops and volunteers like Pratt, the Puerto Rican people may begin to glimpse a light at the end of a dark tunnel.</body>

    <body>CARRBORO&#x2014;Nestled in a cozy corner of Carr Mill Mall, the converted cotton mill where Carrboro shops, eats and drinks, sits Oasis caf&#xE9;.  Appropriately named, Oasis has a laid-back vibe and a sound system loaded with plenty of Bob Marley, Nick Drake and Joni Mitchell.  
	
	Tea and coffee flow here, but just as often, the customers are imbibing specialized beverages made from kratom, a natural substance that has been gaining in popularity and controversy over the last few years.  
	
	Jamie Cohen, a longtime Oasis regular, says he was introduced to kratom a little over a year ago, and now uses it three or four times a week.  &#x201C;It really helped a lot with aches and pains, but I also found that it was really helpful for my anxiety.&#x201D;  
	
	The Oasis is one of three sit-down establishments in the Chapelboro area that specialize in the sale of drinks and foodstuffs containing kratom, a plant-extracted alkaloid that has been used as a painkiller and antidepressant in Southeast Asia since the 1830s.
	
	Less than a mile away is Krave, a kratom bar at 105 West Main Street in Carrboro. In contrast to the tea house ambiance at Oasis, customers at Krave drink kratom (or kava tea, coffee, yerba mate and other nonalcoholic beverages) in a windowless lounge with enough black lights and surf d&#xE9;cor to makes the place look like an interstellar beach club.
	
	Kratom has gained popularity in the U.S. and Western Europe during only the last ten to fifteen years, and has attracted the attention of lawmakers and the Drug Enforcement Agency to the effects of the substance.  
	
	Elizabeth Gardner, an attorney, activist, and owner of Krave, says she is still worried despite the DEA&#x2019;s reticence.  
	
	&#x201C;Now we&#x2019;re seeing states illegally having their departments of health ban kratom on no evidence, no hearing, and due process,&#x201D; she said.  &#x201C;So now those states have to have people from the state challenge the action, and that&#x2019;s gonna take a lot of time, money, and legal work.&#x201D; 
	
	One reason for the uptick in usage, according to some analysts, is the recent federal crackdown on prescription opioid abuse and distribution, which has left large swaths of chronic pain patients without relief from their symptoms, which severely damages their quality of life.  
	
	While the pharmacology of kratom&#x2019;s active ingredients, 7-hydroxymitragynine and mitragynine, is not fully understood within the scientific community, what is known for sure is that both alkaloids function as full selective agonists for one class of the brain&#x2019;s opioid receptors.  Put in layman&#x2019;s terms, kratom offers a mild opiate-like effect, without fully engaging the parts of the brain that heroin or oxycodone would, significantly lowering (though not eliminating entirely) the risk of physical dependency.  
	
		
	
	It is also seen as a substitute for alcohol. Robert Roskind opened The Oasis in 2013 as a traditional coffee and tea establishment, and was introduced to kratom by his daughter.  
	
	&#x201C;She encouraged me to carry it, and said, &#x2018;Dad I&#x2019;m 29 years old and I&#x2019;ve buried five friends to alcohol&#x2019;&#x201D;, he said.  &#x201C;So that was my initial idea, to sell it to a handful of students who will switch off the booze.  As I got more into it and saw that it was broad-range, I saw how it was used to replace antidepressants and anti-anxiety meds.  Everyone needs upliftment at this time.&#x201D; 
	
	Cohen compared kratom favorably to alcohol, and claimed that hangovers are not an issue.  &#x201C;When you come off of it, it&#x2019;s very gentle and there&#x2019;s actually a little bit of an afterglow.&#x201D;  He also mentioned that he has also used kratom on occasion to treat his insomnia.  
	
	As with any substance, overuse is known to bring negative side effects.  &#x201C;About three to five percent [of my customers] experience long-lasting nausea&#x201D;, said Roskind.  &#x201C;And it seems to be older people with other medications in their body.&#x201D;  
	
	Some individuals report psychological habituation after long-term use.  However, one can find just as many accounts of patients weaning themselves off heroin and painkiller addictions with kratom&#x2019;s assistance.
	
	The federal Drug Enforcement Agency has had kratom in its sights for a while now, and came close to instituting a nationwide ban, after announcing that it would use its emergency scheduling power to pull it off the market in August of last year. The pushback was immediate, loud, and bipartisan.  
	
	Two U.S. representatives, Mark Pocan (D-WI) and Matt Salmon (R-AZ), drafted a letter to the DEA&#x2019;s budget and administrative office requesting that any prohibition be delayed until proper scientific vetting of the agency&#x2019;s evidence was possible.  
	
	Much to the kratom lobby&#x2019;s surprise, the DEA backed off and has not publicly approached the issue since.  
	
	It was reported on Oct. 19 that the advocacy group American Kratom Association has filed a Freedom of Information Act request with the DEA and FDA for all relevant documents and communications relating to the proposed ban.  The AKA claims to be looking for proof of a &#x201C;shadow campaign&#x201D; against kratom at the state and local level; they speculate that there is an orchestration &#x201C;of hostility.... on the part of law enforcement officials to deny consumer access to kratom products.&#x201D; 
	
	 All this comes on the heels of the resignation of Donald Trump&#x2019;s freshly appointed drug czar, Tom Marino, after evidence of pharmaceutical industry cronyism was uncovered by the Washington Post and &#x201C;60 Minutes&#x201D;.  
	
	&#x201C;I&#x2019;m much more optimistic this week than I was last week,&#x201D; said Roskind. &#x201C;I think the government will be reluctant to go after it since they&#x2019;ve been shown to be corrupt.&#x201D;  
	
	Gardner said she believes that the biggest hurdles for kratom advocates are the complexity of the scientific research, and institutional stubbornness on the part of the medical profession.  
	
	&#x201C;We have a PR problem, not a science problem,&#x201D; she said.  &#x201C;I&#x2019;m concerned about our government and law enforcement understanding that it is nothing synthetic.  This is not mind-altering, this is not dangerous.  I don&#x2019;t think it should be regulated at all.&#x201D;  </body>

    <title>Arrest in Davie Poplar Fire</title>
    <subhead>Explosion Injured UNC Astronomer Reichart</subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>&#xD;
		&#xD;
				CHAPEL HILL &#x2013; Former UNC student Joshua Daniel Edwards, 24, was formally charged with six felonies Thursday at his first court appearance for the explosion at the famous Davie Poplar tree on the University of North Carolina campus, which injured UNC professor Dan Reichart.
	
		The incident occurred on November 2 when a backpack and guitar was set on fire at the base of Davie Poplar. When Edwards was immediately apprehended by UNC Police and then taken to UNC Medical Center for psychological evaluation, he said there was another device in his car in Carrboro. 
	
		Warrants for his arrest were taken out by UNC Police, but they had to wait for Edwards&#x2019; release from the hospital. He was released, charged and brought to his first appearance Thursday, November 16.
	
		&#x201C;He is being held at Orange County jail on a $200,000 bond in Hillsborough&#x201D;, said Randy Young of the UNC Department of Public Safety.
	
		&#x201C;The individual is not considered a threat to the community&#x201D;, Young added.
	
		Edwards is a white male who gave two different addresses on his arrest reports. One places him in Hillsborough and the other one in Durham.
	
		Edwards is facing felony charges of malicious use of explosives to inflict injury, use of explosives to damage property, assembling a weapon of mass destruction, setting a fire to grass/grasslands, assault with a deadly weapon inflicting serious injury, and filing a false police report.
	
		UNC professor Dan Reichart was trying to put out the fire when a camp fuel canister in the backpack exploded. He was rushed to UNC Medical Center and was treated for second-degree burns on his face and arms. He was released from the hospital on November 17.
	
		Young said that he does not expect Edwards to be released before his next court appearance, set for Wednesday, November 22.
	
		The original incident caused a shut-down of the UNC campus, and an evacuation of McCorkle Place on campus and half of downtown Carrboro. Carrboro Police Department, with the aid of the Durham County Sheriff's Department's bomb squad, blew off the trunk of Edward's vehicle, but found no explosive device.
	
		Davie Poplar is a famous large tulip poplar tree sharing the same lawn with the Silent Sam statue. The tree is named in honor of Revolutionary War General and UNC-Chapel Hill founder William Richardson Davie, and is believed to be around 375 years old. It is singed, but will reportedly survive the incident.&#xD;

			CARRBORO&#x2014;The great metal sculptures twisting in the wind on the corner East Poplar and West Main were made by local artist Mike Roig.
	
	When you see the metallic giants winking at you in the sunshine, do you ever wonder how they were made?  Did your children ever walk by and pretend they were aliens or dinosaurs, and ask you twenty questions about the gentle giants?  Once a year, the Orange County Artists Guild pulls back the veil and invites the public to tour their studios and see where and how the art begins its journey to completion. 
	
	Mike Roig grew up all over the map. His father was in the Air Force. He lived in Massachusetts, California and Maryland, and then moved to North Carolina &#x201C;chasing a woman.&#x201D;
	
	That was back in 1985, and he has been here ever since. Roig was always into art, even as a child. &#x201C;I knew from the beginning that it was what I liked to do,&#x201D; said Roig, &#x201C;But I didn't know if I could make a living doing it.&#x201D;
	
	Roig didn't always do sculptures. Before he moved from Maryland, he took welding classes at the University of Maryland, and worked on collages with scrap metal.
	
	&#x201C;My skills just slowly became more refined, and eventually I started sculpting,&#x201D; Roig said.
	
	His wife, Clay Carmichael, was off working on another project as Roig finished a sleek cat piece in the studio. She is an artist in her own right, and is also one of the Artists Guild&#x2019;s featured artist this year.
	
	Carmichael is also a novelist, and writes and illustrates children's books. She is known for her gentle characters in stories such as &#x201C;Brother, Brother&#x201D;, &#x201C;Wild Things&#x201D;, &#x201C;Bear at the Beach and other Adventures,&#x201D; and her riveting novels, like &#x201C;Zoe.&#x201D;
	
	Roig's work is on display from Syracuse, N.Y. to Georgia Tech to Kingsport, Tennessee. You can see his work locally at Chapel Hill&#x2019;s N.C. Botanical Gardens, and at the N.C. Zoological Park in Asheboro.
	
	Or walk to the corner of Main Street and Poplar Ave, to watch Roig's magical mobiles flash the sunlight as they turn in the wind.

    <title>Was the Restore Campus Free Speech Act designed to stifle protest?</title>
    <subhead>New NC Law Could Be Used to Curtail Campus Dissent</subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>CHAPEL HILL&#x2014;As dozens of people took their seats in a conference room at the Carolina Inn on November 15 to participate in a public comment session about the university's statue of a Confederate soldier, UNC Board of Trustees chairman Haywood Cochrane informed the crowd that under a new law (House Bill 527) anyone could be removed from the building for disrupting the meeting.
	
	Also known as the Restore Campus Free Speech Act, the law had indeed taken effect, though all it does is create a mandate for the UNC Board of Governors to create policy punishing students and others for infringing on free speech.
	
	That policy has not been crafted, and controversy abounds over the law, which critics say draws a punitive curtain around acts of protest and dissent on campuses. Members of the board say the campus dissent policies they draft will include expulsion from campus as an ultimate course of punishment.
	
	"The policy doesn't prevent people from expressing their viewpoints," Board of Governors member Steven Long said in a telephone interview.
	
	Its goal, he said, is to protect free expression rights and promote free speech by establishing a system for maintaining accountability among students who participate in protests. "It provides a form &#x2013; a process &#x2013; for people to respect the free expression rights of others."
	
	Long believes that campus administrators as well as the community will support the policy. The law requires campus administrators to support it, but the public may be harder to persuade.
	
	"It's supposedly a bill meant to allow complete freedom of speech on campus, which I'd be on board with," said Mariam Turner, a graduate student at UNC-Chapel Hill studying law and mass communication who has monitored the legislation very closely.
	
	"As a rule, I like free speech," Turner said. "The problem is that it does that by creating a sanction for anyone who 'interferes with the...free expression rights of others ... including protests and demonstrations'."
	
	Though the law has been in effect for nearly four months, its tools have yet to be sharpened. That will be the job of the UNC Board of Governors, the body that sets policy for the University of North Carolina system of 17 campuses.
	
	Students can be sanctioned for violating it, and others can be removed from campus events if administrators feel they are being provocative or disruptive.
	
	The new rules would apply to approximately 224,000 students enrolled at North Carolina's 16 state universities and, presumably, the NC School of Science and Mathematics, the country's first public residential high school for gifted students.
	
	Roots in Goldwater Institute
	
	HB 527 was based upon model legislation developed by the conservative Goldwater Institute. The bill is the first crafted upon the institute's model legislation to be passed into law, its author Stanley Kurtz affirmed in an article published in The National Review.
	
	Kurtz, an academic who covers the topic of campus free speech as a journalist, co-authored the report as a member of the Ethics and Public Policy Center in conjunction with the Goldwater Institute.
	
	The Goldwater paper frames its policy against the creation on some campuses of "safe zones", and states that "New devices like 'trigger warnings' and 'safe spaces' shelter students from the give-and-take of discussion and debate."
	
	The Goldwater paper also includes suggestions for legislative language that could be used to curtail "divestment of university holdings on political grounds" by mandating that universities adopt a policy of "institutional neutrality", language that is mirrored in HB 527.
	
	The Goldwater paper is not mentioned by name in the bill (as other papers on campus free speech published by Yale University and the University of Chicago are) but Kurtz writes that North Carolina's lieutenant governor, Dan Forest, was an early supporter of the legislation and suggests that Forest was influential in crafting the Goldwater policy's model legislation.
	
	"I am particularly grateful to Forest, with whom I've been working since shortly after. . . late 2015," Kurtz wrote. "Forest and his staff provided critical early encouragement and support for the approach that eventuated in the Goldwater model bill."
	
	In the NR article, Kurtz noted that the 80-31 vote to pass HB 527 in the North Carolina House of Representatives included 10 Democrats. "Given the intense party polarization in North Carolina, the substantially bipartisan House vote was impressive."
	
	No Democrats voted for the bill when it passed the North Carolina State Senate by vote of 34 to 11. The bill passed into law without a signature from Governor Roy Cooper, a Democrat.
	
	The new law requires that the UNC Board of Governors create a policy to curtail disruptive behavior on state college campuses. That policy, according to the bill, will impose sanctions on students who disrupt campus events &#x2013; namely, protesters. The bill holds campus administrators accountable for enforcing those sanctions in the form of an annual report.
	
	The first report is due to be presented to the Board, the Governor and the General Assembly by September 1, 2018; and will be prepared by The Committee on Free Expression, an eleven-member group that HB 527 established for this express purpose.
	
	What exactly will be required of campus administrators remains unclear, at least until the next Board of Governors meeting, and the success or failure of that policy isn't likely to be clear either until next September, when the first report is due.
	
	Topical Dissent
	
	Though the four-page bill had enough support at the legislative level to get passed into law, some including Turner argue that it's a roundabout way of politically strong-arming protest at university campuses.
	
	Turner pointed to the vague and arbitrary language that the bill uses, while questioning how such a policy would play out in reality.
	
	"Based on the wording, literally anything that makes the speaker uncomfortable could be a disruption," Turner said. "A loud coughing fit could be a disruption, if the speaker complains enough. How is it creating an environment conducive to free speech when it's making protests subject to discipline? Exactly whose speech is being furthered here?"
	
	Turner was also concerned about the authority granted to the Board of Governors and its potential ability to influence expression on campuses.
	
	"Whose bright idea was it to pick the committee from the [Board of Governors]? It's a poorly thought out piece of legislation, with the potential to be abused by any speaker with an ego fragile enough to be rendered speechless by a protest."
	
	She added, "It's a bullshit attempt to force schools to do what politicians want them to do by encasing it in pretty 'we want free speech' language."
	
	Cultural Reverbs: Past and Present
	
	The bill was hardly crafted in a cultural vacuum. Political friction and the voice of unexpunged racism in America has refocused attention on the issue of campus dissent, including a notable instance at Middlebury College resulting in the attack of controversial statistician Charles Murray and professor Allison Stanger, who was to debate Murray in academic discussion; and the interruption of a planned appearance in February by discredited "alt-right" figure Milo Yiannopoulis with violence against police and cancellation of the event at UC Berkeley.
	
	Since the North Carolina law's passage in June, violence in August erupted over a white-supremacist rally at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville that resulted in the death of a progressive counter-demonstrator, Heather Heyer; and a protest at the University of North Carolina against the Silent Sam, a Confederate soldier. UC Berkeley canceled a so-called "Free Speech Week" with Yiannopoulis in September. Yiannopoulis, who was revealed to have coordinated his work with active neo-Nazi groups, came anyway.
	
	Around the time of a large rally at UNC Chapel Hill against the statue of Confederate soldier Silent Sam, a group calling itself "white identitarians", identified by the Southern Poverty Law Center as a hate group, raised a banner near Appalachian State University in Boone. Members of the public tore the down the banner, whose message urged a rise of the white race in the vein of white-supremacist propaganda used by the Nazi party and the KKK.
	
	Free speech issues on the University of North Carolina campus run back into the deep cultural vein of the 1960s and the infamous Speaker Ban, a piece of legislation passed by the General Assembly in 1963 that outlawed some speakers, including those with ties to communist political theory, from giving addresses on UNC campuses.
	
	Civil Discourse, Civic Dissent
	
	The 2017 Restore Campus Free Speech Act received considerable media attention in the months leading up to its passage on July 31, due to speculation that the legislation concealed an ulterior motive.
	
	Long and fellow board member W. Marty Kotis III sought to address some of those concerns in an interview with The Piedmont Sundial. Long is a Raleigh-based attorney, and Kotis is a commercial developer in Greensboro. Both are UNC alumni.
	
	"In a civilized university system, we expect people have freedom of speech," Kotis said. "It doesn't matter what somebody says; we have to protect this concept of free speech. Even if you don't like it, you have to protect it. That's a core idea of our democracy."
	
	Kotis commended UNC's handling of the Silent Sam protest, which took place in August. However, the actions of some at that event highlighted to Kotis a need for this policy.
	
	"There was a guy down at Silent Sam, and he was trying to say what he wanted to say about the topic," he said. "And he was trying to have a rational discussion&#x2026;and he only got about five seconds in when [someone] with a bullhorn put the bullhorn in his face and started making screeching sounds&#x2026;This is toddler type behavior&#x2026;that's not freedom of speech. That's selective freedom of speech."
	
	Kotis believes that a need for the type of policy that HB 527 turned into law has developed in part due to technological advances, namely social media.
	
	"There's a point that falls into inciting a riot or assault," he said, referring to the use of social media platforms by those seeking attention, as well as personal confrontations between demonstrators. Those are, however, crimes covered under existing laws. Kotis believes that the upcoming policy is a step in the right direction, and that institutions should be held to a higher standard than the community.
	
	"Someone actually said at the Silent Sam protest that they were upset that the other side didn't come because it would have gotten media attention&#x2026;it should be about whatever your specific goal is. There are a whole lot of people who can't articulate why they're protesting."
	
	In spite of the disruption and an estimated thousand protestors, Campus Police made only two arrests. Neither of those individuals were affiliated with UNC. Kotis opined that "trouble" on campuses generally isn't caused by students, but by outsiders.
	
	HB 527 rules do not refer to disciplinary measures against non-students, though it does not prevent the Board of Governors from writing policy that could crack down on persons not affiliated with the University.
	
	"We can ban that person from campus," Kotis said. "We do have control over other people&#x2026;and then criminal charges can be pursued against them as well. You only have certain things you can control, and we want to control what happens on campus."
	
	Kotis also insists that the policy to be implemented by the Board of Governors isn't political.
	
	"This is not relative to the left or the right, but extremist ideological groups that exist [across the political spectrum]," he said.
	
	'Give it a Chance.'
	
	Moving forward, Kotis expressed optimism. The real estate developer likened the new policy to a lease agreement, a contract that can be amended as needed. Like Steve Long, Kotis said he is also unsure about what the metrics of that policy are going to be. In that vein, much of the apprehension over HB 527 stems from the perceived subjectivity in judging its enforcement by university administrators.
	
	At the Nov. 3 Board of Governor's meeting, Long, who is Chair of the University Governance Committee, presented a status report on the development of that policy. Thus far, the Governance Committee has focused on determining what sanctions are to be imposed, under the explicit guidance of the Report of the Committee on Freedom of Expression crafted by the University of Chicago in January 2015, among other resources. The specifics of that policy are scheduled to be discussed at the next Board of Governors meeting on December 15.
	
	"This policy provides a uniform punishment across the system that guides disciplinary bodies in addressing cases of disruption," Long said. "The first offense is subject to a range of disciplinary actions. The second offense, there's a presumption of suspension for one semester, and then the third offense is a condition of expulsion&#x2026;It gives us uniformity and more clarity in how to handle cases."
	
	The Governance Committee adopted a motion to encourage the legislature to reduce the size of the Committee on Free Expression from its proposed eleven members. Members of that committee have yet to be selected, but according to HB 527, that committee serves at the pleasure of the Board of Governors. All employees of the University of North Carolina System and State agencies are instructed to cooperate with the committee.
	
	Next September, the Board will issue its first report on the performance of campus administrators in adhering to the policy. Metrics by which campus administrations will be evaluated have yet to be determined. Those measures will be decided upon by the Committee on Free Expression heading into 2018.
	
	What is known is that this evaluation will take into consideration each institution's grade under FIRE, the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education. FIRE is a Philadelphia-based conservative educational foundation that grades institutions on their protection of First Amendment rights.
	
	Marked with green, yellow, or red (red indicating schools with at least one policy that both clearly and substantially restricts freedom of speech), FIRE's ranking system currently indicates that UNC-Chapel Hill, Appalachian State, ECU, NCCU, and several other public universities maintain a green rating.
	
	NC State has a yellow rating, while Wake Forest University and Davidson College &#x2013; both private schools &#x2013; have a red rating.
	
	It remains to be seen under what scenario campus administrators might be punished for failing to discipline a student. If the policy is used to exert political leverage or as a convenience for administrators, that won't be reviewable until after the Board of Governors' first report, in September, 2018.
	
	"Give it a chance," Long said in response to skeptics. "We're just trying to provide substantive guidance to the disciplinary bodies as they consider these cases."</body>

    <title>Carrboro Has a Nude Calendar, and I Was in It</title>
    <subhead>Carrboro Citizens Bare All for Those Less Fortunate</subhead>
    <subheadTwo>A peek inside Carrboro&#x2019;s nude calendar</subheadTwo>
    <body>&#xD;
		&#xD;
			CARRBORO&#x2014;&#x201C;Nude.&#x201D; That was what got my attention, that is what I overheard, and out of instinct or professionalism I felt compelled to investigate the who, where, and why.
	
	It took a sec for me to register that I&#x2019;d certainly heard the word &#x201C;calendar&#x201D; as well.
	
	I was outside my favorite bar in Carrboro enjoying an afternoon break. Mike Cole was sitting at a picnic table maybe fifteen feet away, talking with a mutual friend, and though there were only a few people outside on the patio at 2nd Wind, I waited until he was alone to approach him. Carrboro&#x2019;s a small town, and you don&#x2019;t want to be pegged as the guy who corners somebody at the slightest possible mention of nudity.
	
	Cole is a sweet, unassuming guy with an infectious smile that beams through a sandy Duck Dynasty beard. His manner naturally makes people feel at ease &#x2013; comfortable in their own skin.
	
	So I asked. And as it turns out, he was organizing a nude calendar.
	
	&#x201C;It&#x2019;s my little brainchild,&#x201D; Cole said. &#x201C;It all started from a Christmas card me and my wife did.&#x201D;
	
	Cole and his wife took a risqu&#xE9; holiday-themed photo, turned it into a Christmas card and sent it to some family and friends. The response was overwhelmingly positive. They loved it.
	
	&#x201C;Everyone was like, &#x2018;what&#x2019;re you gonna do next year?&#x2019;&#x201D;
	
	The idea evolved to include other people, and quickly became a calendar featuring locals from not only Carrboro but throughout the Triangle.
	
	All for a good cause: the calendar will be marketed locally with all proceeds donated to a charity, which for reasons of seamliness is going unnamed as the nude calendar&#x2019;s beneficiary.
	
	The notion of helping the less fortunate during the holiday season has those involved feeling warm even in their birthday suits.
	
	James Tripp got involved for some added modeling experience, and because he wanted to help raise money for the charity involved. He&#x2019;s also helped with some behind-the-scenes work, locating a photographer and helping to organize the shoots.
	
	&#x201C;It&#x2019;s such a good organization,&#x201D; he said, &#x201C;and I expect Mike in his goofy nature to get enjoyment out of it as well, [while] bringing the community together.&#x201D;
	
	Cole and the others involved emphasized that you don&#x2019;t have to actually be nude to participate in the calendar.
	
	With that, I grabbed a leopard-print thong and set out to do some gonzo reporting.
	
	The shoots were scheduled through a private Facebook page at venues throughout Carrboro, outside of business hours, of course. I participated in two &#x2013; the first, December&#x2019;s Christmas shoot at The Cave, and the other, scheduled a week later, was at the Northside District on Rosemary Street, with the theme &#x201C;April showers&#x201D;.
	
	I wasn&#x2019;t sure what to expect, and being on public display made me feel a bit self-conscious. But I wasn&#x2019;t alone.
	
	We met at noon outside The Cave. There were six of us, and almost everyone had met everyone else at some point. The photographer, Amy Parlier, had each of us sign a liability waiver, which granted the organizers right to use the photos.
	
	&#x201C;I was always the type of person that was [self-conscious] about my body,&#x201D; James Tripp said, &#x201C;and it made me more open and more accepting of my body once I put it out there, and I&#x2019;ve seen that over the course of these shoots that other people have experienced the same thing.&#x201D;
	
	Whatever tension there may have been quickly evaporated. We split up, stripped down, and reentered the room, suddenly knowing each other a little better than we had previously. Not everyone was nude, but a few did go full monty.
	
	&#x201C;It&#x2019;s allowed me to get to know people individually that I did not know before, to open up to them,&#x201D; Tripp said. &#x201C;When you&#x2019;re standing next to someone naked, you&#x2019;re more open to talk to them. It&#x2019;s a very jovial, joking type of atmosphere.&#x201D;
	
	We gathered on stage, and had a bit of an improv show. With Amy directing and Mike Cole &#x2013; who was also in the shoot &#x2013; assisting, we opened faux-wrapped gifts, engaged in wrapping paper swordfights, and took a couple of Olan Mills family-esque shots.
	
	In short, we had an absolute blast. The shoot itself lasted maybe fifteen minutes. Everyone laughed, and by the end self-consciousness was nil. We had lost sight of our vulnerability and were arguably more comfortable around one another than if we&#x2019;d been suited.
	
	&#x201C;The way the models are interacting in the photo shoot, it&#x2019;s not sexual,&#x201D; Parlier said. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s an art project. It promotes community, it promotes diversity, and it promotes understanding,&#x201D; Parlier said. &#x201C;It makes people feel very supported,&#x201D; she added.
	
	&#x201C;It gets people together to do something that&#x2019;s not an everyday thing,&#x201D; Cole said. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s not a sexual thing. . . . There are people with body issues, and it&#x2019;s helped them to face those fears.&#x201D;
	
	Both shoots initially seemed a little heavy in male participants, with two women in each shoot, out of six total people at both. But the stage setups and chemistry among everyone made it work perfectly. Also, the twelve calendar months include a varied cast of local participants.
	
	&#x201C;In the political climate we&#x2019;re in right now, I think that it&#x2019;s community building,&#x201D; Parlier said.
	
	At Northside District the following week, three of us reappeared from the previous shoot. Everyone held strategically placed umbrellas &#x2013; outside, no less - for the &#x201C;April Showers&#x201D; picture. This session included what turned out to be an endearing Valentine&#x2019;s Day shoot for February, in which two winged Cupids shot suction cup arrows at two couples.
	
	&#x201C;It&#x2019;s so positive,&#x201D; said Amy. &#x201C;We were figuring out the lighting, the stage setups, and. . . people are getting really playful with it. Nobody&#x2019;s been weird, at all.&#x201D;
	
	It was fun, and managed to somehow be romantic for everyone, the singles included. Tripp was wearing lingerie for the Valentine&#x2019;s shoot and suggested that one of the other males don a corset.
	
	In doing so, Tripp became privy to an impromptu and endearing event between husband and wife.
	
	&#x201C;Her putting on the corset for him was just a beautiful moment&#x2026;[to see] them do that thing together as a couple, a married couple,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;Most women go through these ordeals of putting on elaborate negligees and outfits, and he&#x2019;s now done this for her in this setting. It&#x2019;s just a beautiful moment. . . She was looking into his eyes during the shoot, she was just happy.&#x201D;
	
	&#x201C;It&#x2019;s really fun, and freeing,&#x201D; he said, smiling. No stranger to this naked modeling stuff, Tripp&#x2019;s nude portrait, painted by artist Lindsay Dunbar, hung on the wall at 2nd Wind for several weeks into summer before it too was sold for charity.
	
	The calendar is expected to be completed and distributed for sale throughout Carrboro in time for Christmas.

    <title>Water levels not too low to meet demand</title>
    <subhead>OWASA reps: 60% capacity sufficient for Orange County needs</subhead>
    <subheadTwo>Reservoir levels fell in dry October and November</subheadTwo>
    <body>ORANGE COUNTY&#x2014;An autumn drought has diminished water capacity, but low seasonal demand will leave a water suppply currently posted at 66 percent sufficient to meet the public&#x2019;s needs, according to the Orange Water and Sewer Authority.
	
	Sinking water capacity numbers are visible to drivers on Jones Ferry Road on a placard outside the OWASA treatment facility and headquarters. Some months ago, their water capacity numbers were in the 90s.
	
	&#x201C;We track rainfall levels at our two water stations at the water treatment plant and at the Cane Creek Reservoir, and it has been below average this year,&#x201D; said OWASA sustainability manager Mary Tiger.
	
	&#x201C;In November, December and January, demand is really low, so we can perform really well with lower levels,&#x201D; she said. OWASA serves about 83,000 of Orange County&#x2019;s 140,000 residents, according to data presented through the U.S. Department of Energy and U.S. Census Bureau.
	
	According to National Weather Service statistics, the average precipitation in the Orange County area for October is 3.78 inches (the month&#x2019;s rainfall in 2017 was .68 inches), November&#x2019;s average 3.7 inches (1.24 inches fell last month). Average December rainfall is 3.54 inches.
	
	For the months of November through January, the water level capacity would have to hit 35% before OWASA would go to Stage I water restrictions, according to the utility.
	
	&#x201C;If we go through the winter without significant rainfall, then we will be worrying in May when the capacity needs to be at 60% to meet demand,&#x201D; Tiger added.
	
	OWASA serves southern Orange County [Chapel Hill and Carrboro] and draws from the Cane Creek reservoir, University Lake and the Quarry Reservoir, whereas northern Orange draws from Lake Orange and the West Fork Eno reservoir.
	
	These bodies of water, too, are at lower-than-average levels.
	
	The Town of Hillsborough&#x2019;s water is supplied to approximately 6,000 customers.
	
	&#x201C;Normally, we have plenty of water this time of year, but we are in a mild drought,&#x201D;said former Hillsborough town engineer Kenny Keel, now with McAdams Engineering &amp; Consulting Firm.
	
	Hillsborough goes into three stages of restriction level based on days of supply remaining. Stage I (voluntary restrictions) is less than 180 days, Stage II at less than 135 days (mandatory restrictions) and Stage III at less than 90 days (rationing).
	
	&#x201C;We currently have 240 days remaining&#x201D;, said Hillsborough town manager Eric Peterson. &#x201C;We are not in restrictions or close to restrictions.&#x201D;
	
	In November, Hillsborough had a water supply to last 302 days, according to Keel.
	
	&#x201C;We have never reached mandatory restrictions in Hillsborough,&#x201D; Keel added.
	
	Below is the description of what would happen at Stage I, according to OWASA:
	
	In the event that OWASA declared a Stage One water shortage, OWASA would advise the mayors of Carrboro and Chapel Hill and the chairman of the Orange County Board of Commissioners of its declaration, and request that they issue proclamations of a Stage One water supply shortage.
	
	Upon OWASA&#x2019;s declaration of a Stage One water shortage, these actions would be taken with the goal of reducing overall water demand by ten percent (according to the utility):
	
	1. Spray irrigation of turf grass using OWASA-supplied potable water shall not occur more than one day per week, with a maximum of one-half inch of water applied to plant material in any given week. Odd-numbered properties shall be allowed to spray irrigate only on Tuesdays; even-numbered properties shall be allowed to spray irrigate only on Thursdays. Spray irrigation of turf grass shall occur only between the hours of 6PM and 10AM. Owners of public-purpose athletic fields, recreational fields, and/or public purpose botanical sites shall not be subject to the limitations of this subsection if those facilities are operated in compliance with an OWASA-approved water conservation plan.
	
	2. Spray irrigation of non-turf plant materials may occur up to three days per week as provided under the year-round requirements.
	
	3. Irrigation of non-turf plant materials by underground, drip irrigation, micro spray, low precipitation bubblers, soaker hose systems with automatic shutoffs, or by hand held hoses or watering cans may occur at any time or frequency.
	
	Notwithstanding restrictions, the protection of public health, safety, and welfare may, under special circumstances, require the use of limited amounts of OWASA-supplied potable water for such purposes as washing out garbage trucks and cleaning up hazardous or other materials. Such uses shall be permitted during declared water shortages or emergencies, provided that other practical alternatives are not available and water is used in the least practical amount.</body>

    <title>Silent Sam Vandalism Case Against UNC Professor Dropped</title>
    <subhead></subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>&#xD;
		&#xD;
		&#xD;
		&#xD;
			&#xD;
		&#xD;
			CHAPEL HILL&#x2014;Orange County District Court prosecutors dropped a misdemeanor charge of vandalism on Tuesday against UNC associate professor Altha Cravey, who had been charged by UNC Campus Police with damaging a statue of a Confederate soldier by throwing an object at it.
	
	Cravey, who teaches several different geography courses at the University, was accused of damaging Silent Sam, the beleaguered statue at the center of UNC's campus monument controversy. The statue's official name is Memorial to Civil War Soldiers of the University.
	
	According to the police report, officers on Sept. 2 observed a person photographing the statue and later noticed damage to the figure's right cheek. Surveillance footage, which records the statue 'round the clock, showed images of someone circling the monument the night before. Campus Police alleged that the person in the video hurled an object at the statue.
	
	Cravey acknowledged that she appears in surveillance video that was taken as she was leaving campus after a meeting with the American Association of University Professors (AAUP).&#xD;
		&#xD;
		UNC associate professor Altha Cravey, at Roots Bakery Bistro &amp;amp; Bar on Franklin Street.&#xD;
		&#xD;
					Cravey was charged with defacing a monument situated in a public place. It is unclear what punitive measure the District Attorney ever had in mind (the DA's office dropped the charges) if convicted, she would face disciplinary action from the university.
	
	On October 13, Cravey was summoned to the Provost's office where she met with Robert Blouin, among other staff, a university attorney, and Cravey's own attorney.
	
	"It was like, 'we're gonna fire you,'" Cravey said. 'We're gonna first cite you with something you didn't do, and then we're gonna fire you if you don't notify us.'"
	
	"I made a joke at the time," Cravey said. "I said, 'It seems like you're already aware.' Nobody laughed. Nobody even smiled."
	
	Many organizations, including the University of North Carolina, require that their employees inform them of any pending charges as they occur. The organization then follows the proceeding and acts on the result.
	
	Cravey's attorney, Kellie Mannette of the Chapel Hill firm Mannette &amp;amp; Thomas, explained that the university has a relationship with the Chapel Hill Police Department and UNC Police, such that the university administration is notified if a student or faculty member has any legal, potentially criminal interaction with an officer.
	
	On Sunday, Cravey's attorney received evidence from a photographer named McCausland Havens, who provided photos dated August 24 showing the damage to the statue to be pre-existing. Charges were dropped Tuesday before the hearing would have begun.
	
	The hearing was to take place in the Chapel Hill courthouse, which sits across the street from McCorkle Place, the quad on UNC's North Campus where Silent Sam, a confederate soldier who represents University of North Carolina scholars and alumni who died fighting the Civil War, faces north and carries a rifle.
	
	Cravey, a faculty member since 1994, has long been a vocal critic of university policies, the UNC Board of Governors, university system president Margaret Spellings and UNC-Chapel Hill chancellor Carol Folt.
	
	Cravey said she believes the administration on campus has targeted her for her activism. "They're just trying to intimidate me," she said.
	
	In November, Cravey filed a civil suit against the university claiming gender discrimination. She alleges that the altercations between her and UNC are "retaliation for raising concerns of sexual and racial discrimination," according to a federal complaint filed November 7.
	
	Court records show that Cravey, a tenured professor, has twice been denied a promotion from associate professor to full professor &#x2013; in 2005 and 2015.
	
	CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article stated that Dr. Cravey&#x2019;s applications for promotion to full professor were denied in 2005 and 2013. The Department of Geography at UNC Chapel Hill denied Dr. Cravey&#x2019;s applications for promotion in 2005 and 2015. &#xD;

    <title>History&#x2019;s Past and Present: Citizens Speak on Silent Sam </title>
    <subhead>Confederate Statue Honors Campus Dead; Sparked Protest this Semester</subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>&#xD;
		&#xD;
		&#xD;
			CHAPEL HILL&#x2014;The University of North Carolina Board of Trustees held an open session at which members of the public were invited to speak upon the future of Silent Sam, the Confederate statue at the center of a Southern university campus controversy.
	
	Thirty-two people signed a roster to speak, including university faculty members, students and town residents. Some spoke in favor of keeping the statue, others called for its removal, and some voiced concerns about UNC Police actions surrounding protests against the monument&#x2019;s continued presence at McCorkle Place, a central landmark near the university&#x2019;s north campus entrance.
	
	&#x201C;No Q&amp;amp;A, no comments, we&#x2019;re here to listen to your remarks,&#x201D; Chairman Haywood Cochrane said to open the meeting. A large television set at the left of the podium displayed a three-minute timer.
	
	Maya Little, a Ph.D. student who was the first to speak, alleged that UNC has spent $40,000 since 2014 on maintenance for Silent Sam&#x2014;a statue that she says &#x201C;glorifies the enslavement of my ancestors.&#x201D;
	
	Little expressed disgust at the recent discovery that UNC Police officer Hector Borges was apparently working undercover gathering information on protestors, posing as &#x201C;Victor&#x201D;, an auto mechanic and veteran suffering from PTSD. Although she continued past her allotted time, other than a conspicuous look at the clock from Cochrane, the entire membership of the board seemed absorbed by what she expressed.
	
	Derek Shepard spoke next. Shepard is a staff member for UNC&#x2019;s study abroad program, a self-described &#x201C;privileged white male who grew up in a northern state.&#x201D; However, as a UNC staff member, he said he&#x2019;s become increasingly concerned that students feel unsafe now, given the controversy around the statue.
	
	He referenced the now-infamous quote by Julian Carr at the dedication of Silent Sam: &#x201C;One hundred yards from where we stand&#x2026;I horse-whipped a negro wench until her skirts hung in shreds, because&#x2026;she had publicly insulted and maligned a Southern lady&#x2026;&#x201D;
	
	&#x201C;You can hear from every voice around you that this is a noble cause, and yet be so very wrong,&#x201D; one speaker said, suggesting that regardless of what the statue was intended to commemorate, ultimately it stands as a symbol of naivet&#xE9;.
	
	On the topic of Silent Sam, UNC Chancellor Carol Folt has wavered and come short of taking responsibility for the statue&#x2019;s continued presence or removal. The chancellor has said the statue is a public safety concern, while also publicly doubting her own authority to remove it under North Carolina law.
	
	&#x201C;Your hands are tied only if you tie them,&#x201D; said economics professor Buck Goldstein.
	
	Michelle Brown, a senior and student activist double-majoring in women&#x2019;s and gender studies and Hispanic literature, described Silent Sam as &#x201C;a monument to the ideology that says I do not belong in this university.&#x201D;
	
	&#x201C;And I&#x2019;m here to say I belong,&#x201D; she added.
	
	David Brannigan, a 15-year employee of the university&#x2019;s grounds services department, spoke as well. The &#x201C;last straw&#x201D;, he said in a thick English accent, was the discovery of the undercover police officer, Hector Borges. Brannigan resents that the grounds workers, rather than campus police, are tasked with removing protest signs.
	
	&#x201C;Only two people had the courage&#x2026;to refuse,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;One of them [was] an 18-year-old African-American temporary employee who knew that what he was being asked to do was wrong. He was being asked to impede on other peoples&#x2019; free speech rights, and he had the integrity to say &#x2018;no, I&#x2019;m not going to do that.&#x2019; &#x201D;
	
	Brannigan said he felt that campus promotional materials cynically featured people of color for advertising purposes, and that the university was ignoring the wishes of those very people.
	
	&#x201C;Two statues have been moved from the North campus,&#x201D; Brannigan said, referencing two statues that had drawn criticism for alleged racist undertones. &#x201C;We&#x2019;ve done it before, we need to do it again&#x2026;It&#x2019;s up to you to exact a change.&#x201D; With these words he finished to a standing ovation.&#xD;
		&#xD;
		&lt;span style="font-family: open-sans, serif;"&gt;North Carolinians who traveled to Chapel Hill to show support for UNC Civil War monument Silent Sam wave Confederate flags in the foreground&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: open-sans, serif;"&gt;in a photo taken Aug. 26, 2017&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: open-sans, serif;"&gt;; while in the background, anti-monument demonstrators and campus security officers are milling around the statue. Photographer: Thomas Hartwell.&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;
		&#xD;
					Several referenced &#x201C;For All Kind&#x201D;, the motto used to promote UNC&#x2019;s ambitious $4.25 billion fundraising campaign. All but three of the speakers asked that the beleaguered statue be removed from campus.
	
	One of those who advocated against removal of the statue was Eunice Brock, 87, a UNC alumnus and community activist. &#x201C;In my younger years,&#x201D; she said, &#x201C;I marched and stood on Franklin Street for civil rights&#x2026;I had my time in court.&#x201D;
	
	&#x201C;It&#x2019;s good that young people protest,&#x201D; she said in an interview. Brock marched for civil rights, rallied against the war in Vietnam, and supported Chapel Hill&#x2019;s first black mayor, Howard Lee.
	
	Brock identified with the passion of the students, and though she supports that passion, she feels their attention is misplaced. &#x201C;I applaud your opposition to racism, but I am against the removal of Silent Sam because I do not believe that it expresses racism.&#x201D;
	
	&#x201C;What good would it actually accomplish if it is torn down? It represents a part of history, which is both good and bad&#x2026;and it cannot be erased&#x2026;&#x201D; Brock said. &#x201C;I see a poor soldier, not a general astride a horse. Rather, I see a foot soldier holding a musket and an empty ammunition pouch looking into the distance and perhaps thinking of returning to his impoverished home and homeland.&#x201D;
	
	Brock felt that the 321 alumni who died in the Civil War, and the circumstances under which they died, demanded a monument, and that Silent Sam is not necessarily a monument to the Confederacy. Her words drew murmurs from within the crowd.
	
	She described it as a piece of art, sculpted by Harvard Professor John A. Wilson. &#x201C;Other pieces of his work are in the Smithsonian museum,&#x201D; she said. To rid the campus of that awful reminder, of life lost, she said would be an Orwellian crime.
	
	&#x201C;I would like to see the history of Silent Sam inscribed on a bronze plaque,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;I would also like to see a statue of an African-American woman of the time, such as Harriet Tubman, displayed in the same area.&#x201D;
	
	&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s not tear down, but rather educate ourselves on the past in order to build understanding among us,&#x201D; she said to applause.
	
	She challenged the audience to consider a more multi-faceted view of history, and of people.
	
	&#x201C;People keep talking about Julian Carr as a racist, and they&#x2019;re right about that, as many other people of the time. But he was also a philanthropist,&#x201D; she said. Brock then listed Carr&#x2019;s contributions to society &#x2013; his support for women&#x2019;s suffrage, including an endorsement from Susan B. Anthony, and land grants to Duke University and also to North Carolina A&amp;amp;T.
	
	&#x201C;So, there&#x2019;s angels and devils in all of us&#x2026;&#x201D; she ended, with several crowd members standing and applauding.
	
	In an interview, Brock elaborated that she thinks protestors&#x2019; efforts would be more productive if they were focused on others in the community, for example improving conditions in the Durham County jail, where an inmate, Uniece Fennell, committed suicide in March. &#x201C;The conditions and the abuses that prisoners there endure are unspeakable,&#x201D; she said.
	
	She feels that Silent Sam is a needed reminder of the sometimes-grim reality in which we live, and that removing it will not resolve the tensions that have surrounded it. As for Sam&#x2019;s future, the octogenarian said she believes the controversy will be forgotten as students prepare for exams.
	
	SILENT SAM FACT SHEET
	
	The statue depicts a soldier in Confederate garb with a rifle but no ammo case, said to be a deliberate omission on the part of the sculptor. It was designed by Nova Scotia-born sculptor John Wilson, who completed the work in Boston in 1913, having during that period created numerous Civil War monuments depicting rank-and-file Union and Confederate soldiers. The United Daughters of the Confederacy paid $7,500 to commission the statue, which was cast by Gorham Manufacturing Company of Providence, RI.
	
	Its legacy was besmirched at its 1913 unveiling thanks to a viciously racist dedication speech by Julian Carr, in which the town of Carrboro&#x2019;s namesake boasted that &#x201C;100 yards from where we stand,&#x201D; after the Confederate surrender at Appomattox, Carr himself had &#x201C;horse-whipped a negro wench until her skirts hung in shreds, because upon the streets of this quiet village she had publicly insulted and maligned a Southern lady, and then rushed for protection to these University buildings, where was stationed a garrison of 100 Federal soldiers.&#x201D;
	
	Silent Sam was at the center of a tumultuous protest in the first week of the current semester that drew a crowd of approximately 1,000 people calling for the statue&#x2019;s removal. The August 22 protest came in the wake of violence in early August at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, which involved counterprotestors clashed with avowed white supremicist groups who opposed the removal of a statue of Robert E. Lee.&#xD;

    <title>Wage Stagnation? These North Carolina Biz's Say No</title>
    <subhead></subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>CARRBORO&#x2013; Based on a cost-of-living metric, the living wage in Orange County is $13.70 per hour, nearly twice the federal minimum wage.
	
	That is according to Orange County Living Wage, an advocacy group that promotes businesses that pay a cost-of-living living wage to workers in Orange County.
	
	If the employer pays at least half of the employee&#x2019;s health insurance, the wage is $12.20.
	
	&#x201C;We were launched in 2015,&#x201D; said Susan Romaine, who chairs the OCLW board of directors. &#x201C;[On] July 1, Marcoplos Construction was our very first certified living wage company.&#x201D;
	
	The group has just recently certified its 138th living wage employer. Their latest additions are The Barn of Chapel Hill and Starpoint Brewing Company in Carrboro.
	
	The group&#x2019;s creation was inspired by Just Economics, out of Asheville. Just Economics WNC started in 2008 and was modeled after a program initiated by the Tompkins County Workers' Center in Ithaca, New York.
	
	The living-wage metric is based on the cost of living in Orange County and its commuter neighborhood. It takes the average rent for a one-bedroom apartment and then determines the living wage by accounting for rent as one-third of a person&#x2019;s monthly earnings.
	
	The average rental rates for Orange County and its four closest counties are used, and Orange County&#x2019;s rates weighed twice to account for population focus . The calculation produces the cost-of-living metric OCLW uses to determine the living wage.
	
	The federal minimum wage has been set at $7.25 since 2009. OCLW&#x2019;s current living-wage minimum is almost 1.9 times that amount.
	
	Laws allow restaurants and similar employers to pay tipped employees less than the federal hourly minimum wage.Their federal minimum wage is $2.13, which is what qualifying North Carolina employers may pay some wage-earners.
	
	To make the financial jump from less than $3 to more than $13 per hour plus tips is monumental for these employees in the bar and restaurant business.
	
	&#x201C;It's an amazing difference,&#x201D; said Arwen Hernandez, a bartender at the Mystery Brewing Public House, one of OCLW&#x2019;s member businesses. &#x201C;Previously, I made $2.13 an hour plus tips. . . that is standard for a restaurant employee.
	
	Living and working in the same locale had side benefits. &#x201C;I can afford to live in Hillsborough,&#x201D; Hernandez said. &#x201C;In fact, I walk to work.&#x201D;
	
	Hernandez also pointed out that, under an OCLW-qualifying compensation rate, her regular paychecks now include withholding, and so now will not owe several thousand in taxes at the end of the year.
	
	OCLW works to promote its employers and network them with other living-wage employers in the county. They produce decals and certifications that let the public know about the individuals and companies that are committed to providing a living wage and plan events that promote a featured business.
	
	The group&#x2019;s latest event was a &#x201C;buycott&#x201D; at Mystery Brewing Company in Hillsborough. People came to financially support a local living-wage business. The aim is a positive reversal of the traditional boycott, wherein people withhold financial support from targeted institutions or industries.
	
	&#x201C;We promote our living wage employers through social media, networking and our quarterly buycotts,&#x201D; said Romaine.
	
	For the &#x201C;buycott&#x201D; on a holiday weekend , Mystery Brewing Company&#x2019;s brew pub near Hillsborough&#x2019;s West End was packed inside and out on their large patio.
	
	Another bartender in Carrboro said their experience in a living-wage environment has also elevated life.
	
	&#x201C;I have worked at Beer Study for four years now, and over a year ago they switched to a living wage,&#x201D; said Britton Van Vleek. &#x201C;It made a very big difference to me.
	
	&#x201C;It definitely encourages me to stay with Beer Study, and we have had very low turnover for this type of job. And I think that it has a lot to do with what we are paid.&#x201D;
	
	Orange County Living Wage also works closely with a broader coalition, Raising Wages NC, which is working to raise the minimum wage to a living wage across the entire state.
	
	Michael Young of Raising Wages NC said, &#x201C;We introduced a bill to raise the minimum wage [in] the state this year, but it did not make it to the floor. We find working with municipalities to pay a living wage to their municipal and county workers to be a great first step.&#x201D;
	
	&#x201C;Polling across the state has shown that 60 percent of those polled agree that the minimum wage needs an increase,&#x201D; Young said.
	
	Besides OCLW, Raising Wages NC also works closely with Just Economics and Durham Living Wage.
	
	&#x201C;[Washington,] D.C. and 29 states have raised their minimum wage,&#x201D; Romaine said. &#x201C;Our goal is to be at $13.70 on January 1 and to be at $15.00 by 2020.&#x201D;
	
	This is not a pipe dream in our area. Both Carrboro mayor Lydia Lavelle and Durham mayor Bill Bell marked Labor Day as Living Wage Day in their respective cities and pledged to &#x201C;see our city make a commitment to be on the path to $15 an hour for all city workers.&#x201D;
	
	According to Young, there are already over 700 businesses in North Carolina that offer a living wage.
	
	In 2015, 14 cities and counties in Washington, Oregon, New York, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, California and Montana agreed to incrementally raise their minimum wages to $15. On a state level, 19 states and Washington, D.C., have raised their minimum wages. In 2016 alone, Alaska, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nebraska, New York, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Vermont and West Virginia raised their minimum wage by between $.05 and $1.00 an hour.
	
	Close to home, the Orange County group&#x2019;s efforts have steered local businesses to elevating wages on a voluntary basis.
	
	&#x201C; We pride ourselves in having a very positive approach,&#x201D; Romaine said. &#x201C;We certify them, promote them and then encourage others to network with these living wage businesses. They get to build a stronger business with better and more committed employees, and help be part of supporting a stronger local economy and community.&#x201D;
	
	LIVING WAGE FACTS
	
	This increase from the federal minimum wage is apparent in the changes in the cost of living in the United States since the Fair Labor Standards Act passed in 1938.
	
	The U.S. Census Bureau puts housing prices for the median home at $7,354 in 1950, $119,600 in 2000 and $230,400 today.
	
	Federal reports show the cost of living rising 2 to 3 percent when inflation is low, with spikes when inflation was high . High inflation caused a jump in the 1980s, with a 14.3 percent increase in 1980 alone. High energy prices triggered another spike in 2008, with a 5.8 percent increase.
	
	The rental market shows similar patterns. According to the federal census, the average rent in the U.S. has increased from $568 in 1960 to $1,200 in 2017. From 2000 to 2010, household incomes fell by 7 percent while rents rose by 12 percent. From the 1960s to 2014, inflation-adjusted rental rates have risen 64 percent while household incomes only increased by 18 percent.</body>

    <title>In Maria's Wake, North Carolina Reaches Out</title>
    <subhead></subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>Since the devastation of Hurricane Maria, U.S. citizens and private organizations across the country have found ways to send volunteers and aid to Puerto Rico.
	
	As the North Carolina National Guard deployed to help the ravished island, other Carolinians were heading there themselves as part of aid organizations or under their own volition, searching out local connections to the island and sending supplies.
	
	Home-schoolers, churches, animal shelters, volunteers and the North Carolina National Guard have all been doing what they can to send help to fellow Americans in Puerto Rico while the U.S. territory continues to ask the federal government to step up its efforts in the region.
	
	Kathy Pratt use to be one of the grandmothers who were always present at home-school parent group events held by her daughter, Nikki Harmony, until a few years ago when Pratt returned to Puerto Rico.
	
	When Maria hit the island on September 20, members of her daughter&#x2019;s home-school group started contacting Harmony.
	
	&#x201C;Everyone that called wanted my mother's address so they could send food and supplies to her,&#x201D; said Harmony. So, she did just that.
	
	The 73-year-old Pratt lives in La Parguera, in the southwestern region of the island. The residents were hit with 100-mile-per-hour winds when the hurricane made landfall. Pratt was initially without water for over a week.
	
	&#x201C;I am doing fine now. It is just life,&#x201D; said Pratt. &#x201C;I am still trying to get my house together. I am still receiving boxes of food, water, supplies and toys from friends in North Carolina, Michigan and Washington.
	
	&#x201C;I get up every morning and distribute what I have received to families around La Parguera.&#x201D;
	
	Pratt said that there are neighbors all around her who still have tarps on their houses, with no idea when they will be able to replace their roofs; she estimated that 40 percent of the homes are still without electricity.
	
	The hurricane not only swept Puerto Rico&#x2019;s main island, but dealt severe damage to the territory&#x2019;s smaller islands of Vieques and Culebra and others. The capital, San Juan, was flooded and the island&#x2019;s electrical grid was damaged to the point of destruction, causing widespread blackouts that have lasted months.
	
	Official mortality figures were being reviewed at the time of publication, with informal estimates pushing upward into the multiple hundreds, if deaths occurring from septic conditions after the storm had subsided are counted.
	
	A shortage of clean drinking water was publicized contributed to disease conditions encountered in the days and weeks after the skies had cleared. Public reports documented people drawing water from contaminated wells, and characterized a slow and disordered federal disaster relief response.
	
	&#x201C;People are resilient here, and busting their asses,&#x201D; Pratt said. &#x201C;Everyone is busy cleaning their walls, mattresses and any other furniture they can save.&#x201D;
	
	Since Maria, Pratt and the other islanders still living in the U.S. territory of 3.4 million people have yet to see any official entities come to their door to see how they are faring.
	
	Although most aid comes to Puerto Rico from local churches and volunteers, the people there are slowly recovering, and say that signs of hope are already present. &#x201C;The photos that everyone saw after Maria, where trees looked like nothing more than barren sticks,&#x201D; said Pratt, &#x201C;that is what we saw here too. Well, those trees are now blossoming again.
	
	&#x201C;But Puerto Rico belongs to the United States, and Puerto Ricans are citizens,&#x201D; Pratt said. &#x201C;And I would have expected more help.&#x201D;
	
	The SPCA of Wake County received 39 dogs from Puerto Rico after Maria, when the island's shelters were beyond capacity and needed help.
	
	&#x201C;We had tons of calls, and people coming in specifically for the animals from Puerto Rico,&#x201D; said adoption counselor Ellen Johnson. &#x201C;We now only have one three-year-old little female named Siza left.&#x201D;
	
	(For more information on finding Siza a home, go to spcawake.org.)
	
	Close to 90,000 Puerto Ricans were living in North Carolina as recently as 2014, representing 1.7 percent of Puerto Ricans who were then living stateside, according to a study released in 2016 by the Centro Center for Puerto Rican Studies at Hunter College. According to the report, Puerto Ricans living in North Carolina in 2014 had a combined purchasing power of $1.6 billion.
	
	Since Hurricane Maria, Puerto Ricans started an exodus to the mainland as conditions deteriorated back home; local groups such as Catholic Charities of the Diocese of Raleigh started helping out in that capacity. They had already been sending aid and groups of volunteers to Puerto Rico, Texas and Florida.
	
	&#x201C;The devastation over the summer was incredible,&#x201D; said the organization's Director of Disaster Services, Daniel Altenau. &#x201C;We are also trying to assist families that have evacuated from Puerto Rico.&#x201D; They are currently helping new arrivals in Burlington.
	
	&#x201C;There are about five families that we are working with right now in the Burlington area. We are helping them resettle,&#x201D; said Altenau. &#x201C;As time goes by, we are expecting those numbers to go up.&#x201D;
	
	Altenau said there were multiple stories of why these individuals made the challenging decision to leave their homes and come stateside to live with relatives or resettle.
	
	&#x201C;One of the mothers decided to come here because her elementary-school-aged son is diabetic, and they were not able to receive any medical supplies back home,&#x201D; said Altenau. &#x201C;So, she came here to be with her sister and receive medical care for her son.&#x201D;
	
	Churches like the Community Church of Chapel Hill Unitarian Universalist were raising and sending funds, area families were opening their homes to pets from the region, and children were sending their toys from the Tar Heel State to the children of Puerto Rico.
	
	Catholic Charities is still sending volunteers on weekend trips to Tarboro to clean up after Hurricane Matthew, which hit North Carolina in October 2016, and a team returned from Puerto Rico on November 29.
	
	Wanda Callaco of Fayetteville was part of the crew that went to Puerto Rico. &#x201C;I was in Puerto Rico from November 12 to November 29,&#x201D; said Callaco. I teamed up with the international version of Catholic Charities, called Caritas.&#x201D;
	
	Her group did social work out of San Juan, assessing the needs of the people who came in.
	
	&#x201C;If you came in need of food and water, we could help immediately, but if you needed medical supplies or, say, a refrigerator, then we made a case file on you and passed it on to those that could help.&#x201D;
	
	Callaco moved to North Carolina at the age of 22 when she was stationed at Fort Bragg. Her sister still remains in her home town of Bayamon, near San Juan.
	
	During the Maria cleanup, Callaco worked directly with another volunteer out of Cleveland. Both were chosen because they were originally from Puerto Rico, and knew the language and culture.
	
	&#x201C;There are still many challenges here,&#x201D; said Callaco. &#x201C;Things have improved a little bit, but the grid is so weak. You can get power to a sector, and then two or three days later, it is back down.
	
	&#x201C;Many areas now have water, but it is not safe. You must boil it to even brush your teeth, wash your face, or even shower.&#x201D;
	
	People in the organization were separating supplies as they came in, but some of the places that needed aid the most were hard to reach.
	
	&#x201C;We had local volunteers from those areas driving their own trucks in and picking up their supplies,&#x201D; said Callaco.
	
	&#x201C;I went with a group to Aguas Buenas, and we were the first outside people they had seen since the hurricane,&#x201D; she added. &#x201C;And they were really excited.&#x201D;
	
	Like Pratt in La Parguera, Callaco also saw private citizens from Puerto Rico and the mainland working across the island.
	
	&#x201C;There were a lot of private efforts,&#x201D; Callaco said. &#x201C;There was a group of nurse practitioners &#x2013; like Doctors Without Borders &#x2013; providing medical support, and a group of attorneys that were helping people apply for FEMA.&#x201D;
	
	As the federal government&#x2019;s response continues to falter in the eyes of many islanders, these families and local groups will continue to fill in the gaps along with others around the state, as Puerto Rico continues to need help back home and as they arrive on the mainland.</body>

    <title>Homebound Holidays: Christmas Lights in Hues of Blue</title>
    <subhead></subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>&#xD;

			Carrboro&#x2014;Lawrence Bannostrand is 32 and will be working behind the counter at a Circle K for part of Christmas Day. He's focused, and he's pretty happy.
	
	Lawrence is also a little stressed around this time of year. He takes EMS courses at Alamance Community College, and is almost finished. The hours he works during the holiday season put him a little behind, so he's playing catch-up after work.
	
	"I've got exams coming up, [so I'm] more paranoid than depressed," he said.
	
	What Lawrence wants, he says, is "to help others and make life better for them," which he does in whatever way he can, consistently, every day. He's not where exactly he wants to be, but he's getting there and he knows it. And with that goal in mind, he's content.
	
	Carrboro Police Sergeant Glenn is working his beat in Carrboro for Christmas &#x2013; a twelve hour shift &#x2013; which he's done enough times for it to be routine. Sergeant Glenn, 30, has been with the Carrboro PD for nine years, and he admits that it's difficult not to take his work home with him sometimes.
	
	"It comes with the job," he said. "It's hard to hang the hat."
	
	Sergeant Glenn often sees people on the worst day of their lives, and those days arise a lot around the holidays:
	
	"We get a lot of arguing and domestics [emergency calls for domestic disturbances] on Christmas Day."
	
	The holidays are an emotional time, even a sad painful time for some people. Nonetheless, Glenn is optimistic and at ease. "My feeling during those times is that there are no bad people, just bad decisions. It's good to think that way."
	
	To cut down on potential stress from his Christmas shift, Sergeant Glenn plans his family activities in advance, opening gifts with his wife and children on Christmas Eve.
	
	"We told the kids that we had a talk with Santa and asked him to move us up a day because Dad's got to work," he said, smiling and drumming on the roof of his cruiser.
	
	Thelma Bost is the one making those seasonal lattes at Carrboro's Open Eye Caf&#xE9;. Her grandparents and cousins are flying in from France this weekend. She's 19 years old, and hasn't seen her grandparents in ten years.
	
	There's a bounce in her step. She's happy as she thinks about the future.
	
	Her favorite Christmas memory is of waking up really early with her younger brother, and running to the tree where they'd count and compare presents.
	
	"It's a really unique time of year," she said. "Everywhere you go there's Christmas music and lights. It's a jolly time of year. There's nothing else quite like it."
	
	Most people are celebrating something; if it's not Christmas, Hanukkah, Kwanzaa or another midwinter holiday, it might be the breaks from work and school, the uptick in business or just the new year. But this unrelenting cheer can make the holidays a cynical and melancholy time for some people.
	
	For that reason, for a lot of people the holidays are a sad time. It's painful to see people doing well when you're doing very badly. Not for nothing have psychiatric publications made note of the "holiday blues," a seasonal affective disorder whose symptoms accompany the first TV commercial jingles, and seasonal hymns adapted for department-store public address systems.
	
	When things aren't going so good, it hurts to be told that they should be. But to mention this sounds Grinchy, and spoils others' joy at this, "the most wonderful time of the year."
	
	There's something universal about the holiday season that everyone acknowledges and celebrates. This is the time when we try to acknowledge what is and try to make it into what should be.
	
	"There's light in everything," Angie Schooff said, walking with her husband, Mike, and 10-year-old son, David-Michael. "It's okay, even on Christmas, to spend the day with the blinds closed."
	
	Schoof, 49, is a teacher from Hillsborough. She has a close friend who lost her son last year, and right now Christmas is difficult for that friend. Caring for her, Angie gives her some space to process things, and takes steps to reassure her friend that she is loved.
	
	Angie and Mike plan to attend a Moravian church service in Winston-Salem on Christmas Eve, and take David-Michael to see the new Star Wars film on Christmas Day.
	
	As a lot of people are, Angie Schooff is deeply sentimental about the holidays.
	
	"You think about people that have passed on. It's bittersweet," she said. "Because if you had a good memory, you have to keep those memories alive."
	
	"You can't be hard on yourself during Christmas," Mike Schooff added.
	
	It is our job during the holidays to bring hope. It's our duty to do everything in our power to bring it about, to will it to happen. Right?
	
	Look. Indigestion, alcohol, bloating, loss, longing, and loneliness are all symptoms&#x2014;or side effects&#x2014;of excessive holiday cheer. But what these days are really about is the universal recognition of, and celebration of, our community&#x2014;through darkness and light. 
	
	Indeed, we remind people of what could be. We're thankful when what is is good, and we personally acknowledge that it could be worse. When it's not good, we acknowledge that it was once better and hope that it could be again some year. &#xD;

    <title>Not the Last Laugh: Triangle Comedy&#x2019;s Life After Death</title>
    <subhead></subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>CHAPEL HILL&#x2014;Hit by the shuttering of one of its most active improv theaters, the North Carolina comedy scene is on the rebound as area organizers and mainstay talents determine where tomorrow&#x2019;s punchlines will land. 
	
	This past July, three months prior to the impactful expose of Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein&#x2019;s behavior that kicked off the #MeToo movement, North Carolina&#x2019;s comedy hub was disrupted by accusations of sexual misconduct. Dirty South Improv (DSI), which was for years the only dedicated comedy theater in Durham, Carrboro and Chapel Hill, shut down amid allegations of emotional abuse and sexual misconduct on the part of the club&#x2019;s owner and operator, Zach Ward. In spite of DSI&#x2019;s absence, comedy in the Triangle remains a vibrant milieu full of creativity and talent.
	
	A side effect of the shutdown was that performers who lost their main outlet had to look for new ones without much warning. The loss of DSI&#x2019;s improv groups and performance space was not the only dent created by Ward&#x2019;s disappearance as an organizer. The future of the NC Comedy Arts Festival, a long-standing event affiliated with DSI and Ward, is left uncertain, and the festival&#x2019;s Web homepage is no longer active.
	
	Jennie Stencel, a Greensboro comedy club owner, has expressed her intended plans for a new comedy festival to fill the void, which would result in a shift of activity from the Triangle to the Triad. Stencel, a former news anchor who used to deliver the traffic report in rap verse on KENS-TV in San Antonio, told the publication Raleigh &amp;amp; Company in August that she hopes to establish a festival based out of the club she co-owns, Idiot Box.
	
	DSI was established in 2005 and used a similar business model to the legendary Upright Citizens Brigade theater in Manhattan, where comedians perform for free and stage time is guaranteed only if one is paying monthly dues and working a few shifts per month as box office clerk, usher, or other general staff. This system is in place ostensibly to keep art, not commerce, front and center. Therefore, DSI operated as a for-profit business while using unpaid performers, but most comics who performed on its stage found the arrangement suitable. 
	
	The theater flourished under Ward&#x2019;s leadership for a while, but at a certain point some female comics began to feel unwelcome. Some allegations of inappropriate behavior against Ward date back to 2016. The behavior described on social media comment boards in the summer of 2017 gave a grotesque double meaning to the central commandment for improv performance: &#x201C;Always say yes.&#x201D;
	
	Kate Harlow, a seasoned improv performer, spoke to the Sundial via email. &#x201C;I wasn't 100% aware of the crap Zach Ward was pulling &#x2013; I just knew that he made me miserable personally &#x2013; so I told the theater that I needed to take time away for my niece that was about to be born &#x2013; and I never went back to that theater.&#x201D;
	
	Gossip surrounding Ward and his sexual aggression toward young women became impossible to ignore or deflect when it left the circle occupied only by performers. Once the incidents became public knowledge, community pressure ramped up. Ward announced DSI&#x2019;s closure in July. 
	
	Attempts to reach Ward for comment were not answered.
	
	Vinny Valdivia, the comic whose Facebook posts fired the first shot of Ward&#x2019;s scandal, doesn&#x2019;t consider the club&#x2019;s dissolution a tragedy. &#x201C;Now there are regular shows in Chapel Hill, Durham and Raleigh, and they are all run by different people,&#x201D; Valdivia told the Sundial. &#x201C;Now people have options when it comes to performing and [it] feels more like a community because no one is locked down to one venue, so it&#x2019;s easier for comedians to meet new people and network.&#x201D;
	
	The revelations come at a particular time when the nation, its entertainment industry in particular, has come to a reckoning with regard to the mistreatment of women. For 2017, TIME magazine has named &#x201C;The Silence Breakers&#x201D;&#x2014;women who have spoken out about sexual harassment and coercion in the workplace&#x2014;its Person of the Year. 
	
	Harlow says that for the most part, Triangle comics aren&#x2019;t divided over the Ward debacle. &#x201C;I wouldn't say that the community was polarized. Overall the community united under the banner of &#x2018;This is not OK,&#x2019;&#x201D; Harlow said. &#x201C;I will say that there are people whose silence has been noticed.  But not taking the opportunity to condemn has only made it clear who to consider trustworthy and whom to continue working with in the future.&#x201D;
	
	Some of those who were close to Ward personally said they had to look past a feeling of indebtedness in order to support those victims who came forward. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s hard to condemn someone that gave you [a] chance and made you feel welcome. This is why there is so much power in a position like owning a theater,&#x201D; Valdivia said. 
	
		The toppling of careers and the crumbling of cover-ups and has allowed for a more honest appraisal of women&#x2019;s role in the intellectual development of sketch, improv and stand-up comedy; a long list of brilliant, hilarious and paradigm-shifting women like Phyllis Diller, Jean Carroll, Joan Rivers and Imogene Coca are being given more credit than previously. 
	
	Recent works taking a fresh look at the entertainment history (e.g., Kliph Nesteroff&#x2019;s &#x201C;The Comedians: Drunks, Thieves, Scoundrels and the History of American Comedy&#x201D;; Grove Atlantic, 2015) make the argument that modern improvisational comedy is primarily the brainchild of Elaine May, who experimented with the form during her time with the Compass Players in the late 1950s.
	
	In a recent development, Ali Farahnakian, UNC alumnus, announced plans to take over the former DSI location and open a branch of his New York&#x2013;based People&#x2019;s Improv Theater (PIT). PIT is structured as an educational institute with a paid staff of comedy professors and tuition-paying students (in contrast to DSI&#x2019;s for-profit dues model). But on October 18, Fahranakian himself was the subject of a town hall forum on the Manhattan PIT stage.  He has been accused of inappropriate behavior by at least one former student, and of mishandling sexual misconduct complaints lodged by other women working in the theater.  
	
	For its part, PIT has proactively responded to the situation, and on November 16, Fair Play NC published an open letter to the Chapel Hill theater community on its behalf. Fair Play NC consists of &#x201C;female identifying performers working together to create safe spaces and equity for improvisers,&#x201D; and have taken an active interest in the issues surrounding the break-up of DSI. 
	
	Fair Play NC&#x2019;s letter took an optimistic tone, saying the group was &#x201C;pleased to see that The PIT are taking positive, measurable steps forward toward creating a safer community.&#x201D; These steps include PIT&#x2019;s recent partnership with the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network (RAINN). 
	
	The letter went on to say, &#x201C;These issues at The PIT remind us that there are larger issues in our improv community as a whole. This isn&#x2019;t about one person, or one theater &#x2013; all of us should be working to make our theatres better, safer, and more welcoming spaces.&#x201D;  
	
	PIT held its first show in Chapel Hill at DSI&#x2019;s former theater space at 462 West Franklin Street on December 16.   
	
	 Female comics said they understand that there is still a lot of work to be done before women can feel on equal footing. Kate Harlow is adamant that misogyny is still a problem locally, and that little attention is given to making women feel comfortable. &#x201C;When there are few to no women in charge, it creates an environment where women are not granted respect, and few people take the opportunity to point out when &#x2018;locker room talk&#x2019; is 100% sexist and out of line.&#x201D; 
	
	 Virginia Wallace, a Durham-based comic who has been vocal on women&#x2019;s issues in comedy for years, believes that another hurdle that still needs jumping is the problem of male nepotism. &#x201C;I think there is some opportunity lost because of networks of guys who do things for their friends and don't think of women,&#x201D; Wallace said.
	
	For any aspiring or up-and-coming comic living and working in the Triangle, there are still options for getting stage time. Some of the most popular open-mic events include Tuesday nights at 9 pm at Zog&#x2019;s in Chapel Hill, where comedian/folk singer Josh Rosenstein hosts an evening that is typically split between musical performers and stand-up; as well as similar events at The Pinhook in Durham and Local 506 in Carrboro.  For those looking for the most traditional red-brick comedy club experience, Goodnight&#x2019;s in Raleigh offers an audition-based open-mic once a week. For kids, Walltown Children&#x2019;s Theater in Durham hosts improv acting classes.
	
	Wallace said she will often hit multiple open mics a week, and she expressed optimism about the Triangle comedy scene, despite the summer&#x2019;s dramatic events. &#x201C;I think I have stayed on the scene for several reasons,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;One of those reasons is community. I feel more of a sense of belonging with comics than with other groups of people.&#x201D; 
	
	LOCAL OPTIONS FOR UP-AND-COMING COMICS
	
	Goodnights Comedy Club, Raleigh &#x2013; Open mic, audition-based.
	
	Kings/Neptunes, Raleigh &#x2013; Open mics by schedule.

    <title>NC Covered After Icy Blast; Advisory Warns &#x201C;Black Ice&#x201D; on Roads</title>
    <subhead></subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>A winter storm scraped the Piedmont from afternoon to late evening Wednesday, spreading snow and icy, hazardous conditions across the state of North Carolina.
	
	Most of central and eastern North Carolina is blanketed with snow Thursday, and according to weather forecasts will continue to be under freezing temperatures into Friday.
	
	School was cancelled Thursday for all major school systems in central North Carolina, including public school systems in Forsyth, Wake, Guilford, Durham, Orange and Cumberland counties. Wednesday&#x2019;s precipitation, which began crossing over the western Triangle at around 6 p.m., prompted organizers of other classes and community activities that evening to cancel Thursday&#x2019;s sessions. Wake County Courts and other public offices were closed Thursday for inclement weather.
	
	Governor Roy Cooper declared a state of emergency for North Carolina on Wednesday as a winter system enfolded a large swath of the eastern United States. As of Thursday morning, winter precipitation and a low-pressure system had moved northward from coastal North Carolina over the Chesapeake Bay and New Jersey coastline.
	
	&#x201C;We&#x2019;ve had an area of arctic high pressure [cold air originating in Canada] situated over us for about a week,&#x201D; said James Morrow, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service&#x2019;s Raleigh office.
	
	The frozen mix and flurry precipitation created hazardous driving conditions in central North Carolina, which lingered on the ground Thursday morning as the National Weather Service released an advisory for black ice on the roadways. Multi-car accidents were reported Wednesday night on Homestead Road in Orange County, and U.S. 15-501 between Chapel Hill and Pittsboro.
	
	&#x201C;We can&#x2019;t give an ETA with the roads out tonight,&#x201D; said a driver for a Chapel Hill cab service Wednesday night at 9:30 p.m. Trips from Cary to Chapel Hill took as long as one hour, leading to delayed shift-changes and other workplace disruptions; one worker in the CVS pharmacy at Carr Mill said that she had booked a hotel room in Carrboro where she could sleep Wednesday night rather than attempt to navigate the roads home.
	
	&#x201C;While the snowfall has ended along and west of the US-1 corridor southwest of Raleigh, extremely dangerous travel conditions continue due to snow covered roads,&#x201D; the National Weather Service reported on Thursday morning.
	
	This arctic chill was pulled from the north by the southern jet-stream air currents, which drive most weather patterns in the northern hemisphere; this cold air mass is not an unusual phenomenon in this region, Morrow said.
	
	&#x201C;Typically, in the winter time, we will have shots of really cold air,&#x201D; said Morrow. &#x201C;But what is unusual is the duration; we typically don&#x2019;t get it for two or three weeks at a time.&#x201D;
	
	At 4 p.m. Wednesday, Gov. Roy Cooper declared an official State of Emergency for the entire eastern half of the state, so that resources could be freed up for anti-icing efforts as well as post-storm damage control. There was a wind chill advisory out for 22 counties in the western part of the state.
	
	The cold blast placed some of the community&#x2019;s more vulnerable residents at risk.
	
	Ryan May, a Carrboro man who said he has been homeless in the area for roughly nine years, said he was dealing with the situation by reaching out to local charities for resources.
	
	When asked how he and others will be keeping warm while sleeping outdoors for the next few days, he responded, &#x201C;With just a sleeping bag. Sometimes we try and have a fire going, and right now we&#x2019;re working on getting a gas tank, but that&#x2019;s going to cost us $40.&#x201D;
	
	The sleeping bags were donated by a local church, and May sees this kindness as a part of the supportive attitude of Carrboro in its relations with the homeless population, stating, &#x201C;This area is definitely friendly [to the homeless], May said. &#x201C;A lot of people try and help.&#x201D;</body>

    <title>Freeze and Road Conditions Sustain NWS Alerts</title>
    <subhead></subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>Most North Carolina counties &#x2014; including Orange, Durham, Wake and Chatham &#x2014; remain under National Weather Service alerts through Saturday due to low temperatures and ice left behind after a winter storm that covered the central and eastern state Wednesday evening. Low temperatures and heavy winds were reported in the western part of the state Friday.
	
	Skies cleared Thursday, but lows hung in the teens and single digits overnight, and large parts of North Carolina and the eastern United States have been under a state of emergency since Wednesday, Jan. 3, when Governor Roy Cooper called for one in anticipation of the storm.
	
	The National Weather Service put much of the storm-affected area, and counties experiencing freezing cold, under a winter weather advisory for black ice until 7AM Saturday and a wind chill advisory until 10AM Saturday.
	
	On its website, the National Weather Service said, "Very cold wind chill values are expected again tonight, which can cause frost bite to exposed skin in as little as 20 to 30 minutes." They also added that minimum wind chill values will range around zero degrees tonight.
	
	Forecasts state that temperatures between 10 and 12 degrees were expected as late as 9 a.m. Saturday, with Triangle temperatures not getting above freezing until Sunday.
	
	Many public schools and community colleges remained closed across the region for a second day Friday, but the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Duke, North Carolina Central University and North Carolina State reopened Friday (all were closed Thursday) with a delayed opening for NC Central. By Friday afternoon, all major universities in the Triangle were operating under normal schedules.
	
	According to the National Weather Service, extreme winter conditions began Wednesday in Florida and Georgia and were expected to reach as far as New Hampshire and Maine before the icy storm had run its course. Arctic low temperatures and a tropical low-pressure system converged over North Carolina, with a state of emergency and early school releases announced in expectation of the storm's arrival Wednesday afternoon.
	
	In a few hours on Wednesday, many parts of central North Carolina were covered with more than an inch of snow. Low temperatures ensured that precipitation turned into ground cover, and driving conditions deteriorated. Sustained freezing temperatures have prolonged the hazardous state of roads, even where snow has been plowed off; black ice is a thin, hard-to-see sheet of ice on paved surfaces which can cause a moving vehicle to lose traction and begin sliding.
	
	"The colder temperatures have us facing different challenges", said Chapel Hill Fire Chief Matt Sullivan on Friday. "We are facing repeated black ice issues overnight. This does present additional challenges, but we do have the additional resources to handle it.
	
	The department is using precautionary measures, which include sending personnel out in smaller, lighter vehicles, like SUVs, instead of fire trucks in response to medical calls.
	
	Emergency workers are also doing rounds checking on the status of the homeless community in Chapel Hill.
	
	"They are one of our main concerns," said Sullivan. "Another thing we worry about in colder weather is heating. We do not want people to add alternative heat sources if they are trying to combat the cold. Things like patio heaters or grills could cause carbon monoxide poisoning."
	
	Sullivan advised that people take it slow on the roads, remember that bridges and overpasses freeze first and to check on neighbors.
	
	"Especially your elderly neighbors," Sullivan said.
	
	With electric outages in other parts of the state in mind, Sullivan said, "We lose power in storms sometimes, but the current conditions do not have us worried about power outages in our area."
	
	Carrboro and cities across the area are working round the clock to keep streets safe for their citizens, according to Carrboro Public Works Superintendent Chris Cates.
	
	"Tonight, they will be salting and sanding the slick spots from 7 p.m. to 7 a.n.," Cates said. "We would love for the weather to work with us by reaching above freezing during the day, but that is not the case.
	
	"But we are hanging tough clearing the roads, sidewalks, bike trails and parking lots." Cates advised people to stay indoors where it is warm and to avoid shoveling driveways and other such activities if they are at risk of heart problems.
	
	As far as black ice goes, Cates said, "When you drive over black ice, take your foot off the accelerator and keep the wheel straight...and you should go straight across it."
	
	Public transit agencies across the state have responded to the storm: GoTriangle, GoDurham, GoCary and Chapel Hill Transit were delayed on Friday morning but then were up and running for the rest of the day.</body>

    <title>Despite Another Closure, Triangle Booksellers Say Story Is Far From Over</title>
    <subhead></subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>Travelers who have flown to or from the Triangle have likely spent an hour at Raleigh-Durham International airport, and at least a couple more in the air, consumed by boredom.
	
	For years, as national brick-and-mortar book chains have seen sales decline, frequent fliers who still enjoy the novel fare of a book to occupy their minds above the clouds have turned to Walter and Karen High, the owners of 2nd Edition Books at Terminal 2.
	
	Walter and Karen had fliers' reading needs covered with second-hand mysteries, biographies and more. But on December 31 of 2017, the lease expired and the store closed. The airport may lease the space to a new business. As of January 2, RDU representatives said the airport has no plans for it yet.
	
	Mark and Judy Burnham moved their store (called The Book Cellar at the time) from Carr Mill in Carrboro to RDU in 1984. The Highs partnered with the Burnhams in 1991, and became sole owners by 2008.
	
	A used bookstore in an airport is an oddity, and in some ways the uniqueness worked 2nd Edition Books' favor. Travellers only have a couple options for last-minute entertainment purchases, which usually leaves bargain hunting out of the equation. In that context, selling pre-read classics often for less than the $10&#x2013;$12 mass market paperbacks at other other RDU outlets, like Shaw News or Hudson News, made total business sense.
	
	"You have sort of a captive audience out here," Walter High said. "Especially when flights are delayed and people are forced to get to the airport two hours early."
	
	2nd Edition Books offered a unique experience when compared to their neighboring competitors. "The new bookstores are no fun," said High. "They just have all the stuff on the bestseller list. You come in here, we have 8,000 titles and you never know what you're going to find."
	
	The American public is reading less than they have in a long time. A National Endowment for the Arts survey found that the number of adults reading at least one work of literature (novels, short stories, poems or plays required for neither work nor school) per year dropped 14 percent between 1985 and 2015. It is important to note that includes reading digitally. (For more on that interesting study, read "The Long Steady Decline of Literary Reading," published on September 7, 2016 on The Washington Post's website.)
	
	With the overall market for books shrinking, and much of that market drifting to screen-reading of some type, American bookselling clearly has been in flux.
	
	The market shifts that created today's industry started at least by the mid-1990s, starting with the rise of the big-box bookstore (e.g., Barnes &amp; Noble, Borders, Books-a-million) and then their newly formed relationships with expanding caf&#xE9; brands like Starbucks and Seattle's Best. Of course, the mid-1990s saw the World Wide Web arrive on scene, which Amazon.com used most successfully to create an online market for books. The first e-reader debuted in 2007.
	
	The "Big Six" commercial publishers and corporate bookstore chains did their best to adapt to the new modes of selling and unfamiliar technologies. But the old business model was unsustainable and by the late 2000s Borders filed for bankruptcy, publishing leviathans like Random House and Penguin merged and Amazon engaged in a brutal pricing war with wholesalers Hatchette and Ingram.
	
	At one time, Chapel Hill alone had multiple bookstores, both secondhand and retail, all operating within the same few miles. But with Chapel Hill Comics and The Bookshop shutting their doors half a year ago, Franklin Street is now a literary desert, and Flyleaf Books off Martin Luther King Boulevard is the only non-student bookstore in town. Carrboro has not had a general interest bookstore since the dissolution of Nice Price in March 2013, nor a special interest one since Internationalist Books closed in September 2016.
	
	But Flyleaf Books' lead buyer, Lane Jacobson, does not credit booksellers' and customers' alarmist cries. "The myth of the dying bookstore was true for a very short and intense period of time, but industry-wide it has really turned around," he said.
	
	This resurgence, Jacobson pointed out, is aided by the rise of a movement for localism. "People have seen what happens to their downtowns and communities when you only buy things online; all those things that make Carrboro 'Carrboro' go away."
	
	American Bookseller Association spokesman Oren Teicher confirmed that more independent bookstores are opening than closing. "Nationwide, we are looking at [a] pretty good picture," Teicher said. The ABA's internal survey shows an 8 percent increase in member locations from May 2016 to May 2017, and the growth is expected to continue into the new year.
	
	Teicher also makes a compelling case for broadening one's perspective when examining this issue at the local level. "Actually, the Research Triangle area is a pretty good indie bookstore market," he said, pointing to The Regulator in Durham, Quail Ridge Books in Raleigh and McIntyre's Books in Pittsboro.
	
	There are many reasons why a business might fail, from rent surges to poor customer service; but just because one important street in a town goes book free, that isn't necessarily a sign of an overall negative trend.
	
	Wander Lorentz de Haas, the new co-owner of Durham's Regulator Bookshop, who communicated with the Sundial over email, also believes that Triangle bookselling is as healthy as ever. He says that is in part due to the area's unique and shifting demographics: "[There is a] rapid growth of urban transplants who have been acclimated to indie bookshops."
	
	Boutique publishing houses are playing a role as well. "There have been an insane number of awesome small indie presses popping up the past decade &#x2013; like microbreweries prior &#x2013; that are look for a place to showcase their titles which are otherwise lost on the internet," Lorentz de Haas said.
	
	George Stackpole, an ESL teacher on-staff at McDougle Middle School in Carrboro and a bookstore frequenter, believes that used bookstores specifically can play a role in community cohesion. He said, "In a community that has a used bookstore, in a sense it creates a dialogue... It creates an exchange of ideas on a local level."
	
	The loss of any independent bookstore can cut deep. Bookstores have historically been much more than retail establishments. They serve as cultural centers for communities of readers, writers, critics, activists and more. 2nd Edition Books will be missed by many, but the Triangle's literati need not fret too much. They just might have to visit Flyleaf, The Regulator or Quail Ridge for sky-worthy reading material. Book readers know, that makes the flight take you higher.</body>

    <title>First 2018 Durham City Council Work Session: Housing, Street Repairs and More</title>
    <subhead></subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>The Durham City Council met Thursday for a work session to portion out funds to election cost repayment, affordable housing, increased signage, and repairs to streets and sidewalks. 
	
	Among the items approved was a payment to Orange County Board of Elections for $2,572.35 for Durham&#x2019;s October 2017 municipal primary election. A small portion of Durham lies within Orange County, which conducted the election and billed the City Clerk. According to invoices, the expense breaks down to two thousand dollars in printing costs for ballots and literature, with the remaining balance mostly covering staffing costs.
	
	In addition, the City Council voted to earmark $244,300.00 for HOME Community Housing Development Organization funds. CHDOs are private, community-based nonprofit organizations, recognized by the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development, who develop and/or manage affordable housing. The funds will be used towards 36 one-bedroom apartments located at 1407 West Chapel Hill Street, repaying a $1.8 million bridge loan CASA used to acquire the property. CASA provides homes to people with disabilities or living on lower wages, with properties in the Wake, Durham and Orange counties.
	
	City Council also voted to approve $107,000 to construct an affordable housing rental unit located at 830 Kent Street. The property will provide low-cost housing for families earning below 60 percent of the area median income. 
	
	According to a memo dated December 19 from the Department of Community Development Director Reginald Johnson to City Manager Thomas Bonfield, the funds are a 20-year zero-percent-interest loan to Durham Community Land Trustees, Inc. (DCLT) that is forgivable at the end of the term.  DCLT is a community-based nonprofit organization that acquires properties at below market value and rehabilitates them for subsidized housing. Over nearly 30 years, DCLT has developed more than 200 units throughout Durham. 
	
	The Council also authorized the City Manager to accept $556,600.00 in federal Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality grant funds from the NCDOT. The CMAQ funds are to support the City&#x2019;s wayfinding program &#x2013; introduced during the 2007/2008 fiscal year &#x2013; which reduces pollution by creating signage that aids cyclists and pedestrians with orientation and directs sidewalk traffic to sites of interest in downtown Durham. 
	
	Updates to the wayfinding program will bring the system up to current planning codes, and are a response to projections made in a 2013 study completed by the City of Durham, which showed that of the roughly 15,500 available parking spaces downtown, a significant portion were at 75 percent or greater capacity during normal business hours, and at full capacity during weekend events, while surrounding parking areas were deemed underutilized &#x2013; meaning that less than half of the available spaces were being used. 
	
	The Council also authorized the City Manager to execute a contract with Done Right the First Time Contractors to install and maintain passenger amenities on GoDurham bus routes. The contract runs through January 2021 at a total cost of less than $121,575.00. 
	
	The other two significant items on the agenda included a nearly $1.4 million contract with White Oak Construction for sidewalk resurfacing, and a $6.3 million contract with the Fred Smith Company for repaving, both of which have a 10 percent contingency fund included in the budget. 
	
	Tasha Johnson, Assistant Director for Public Works, spoke enthusiastically about the resurfacing work and how recent technology enables the city to keep maintenance costs down. 
	
	&#x201C;The pavement preservation is a little different,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;What we plan to do is do early treatment during the early life cycle of the road.&#x201D; She offered an analogy: &#x201C;You buy a new car, you do routine maintenance until the car is paid off.&#x201D;
	
	According to Johnson, crack sealant, which is a partial repair of an existing road, hasn&#x2019;t been applied in Durham for quite some time. &#x201C;That&#x2019;s the repair that tends to generate more complaints and concerns,&#x201D; she said. The reason is that even with sealant, cracks are still visible, perhaps more so than before the repair.  
	
	Every three to five years, the City of Durham completes a pavement condition study, which ranks local roadways in one of five categories on a zero-to-100 scale. Johnson provided visual examples of actual Durham streets to illustrate what maintenance would be required in each scenario.  
	
	According to Johnson, until recently it has cost $640,000 over 40 years per lane mile to maintain Durham&#x2019;s streets. However, according to projections regarding the methods used by the Fred Smith Company, Durham&#x2019;s roads could be maintained for little more than half that cost, at $364,000 per lane mile. 
	
	Using materials called Reclamite and cape seal, the City is expected in 2018 to be able to adequately maintain 54 miles of its streets for roughly the same cost that was spent to maintain seven miles of roadway in 2014. According to Johnson, cape seal is a mixture of tar and gravel with a micro-surface overlay. Reclamite, a treatment that includes a mixture of sand and tar, is applied every five to seven years. Sixty-one percent of the proposed budget, would  bring 26 lane miles up to ADA requirements in 2018 by using Reclamite, according to Johnson. 
	
	&#x201C;With our 2017 contract, we used a different treatment type on Woodcroft Parkway,&#x201D; said Johnson, referring to the use of Reclamite and cape seal. &#x201C;We were able to do the treatment earlier and take the savings of roughly 50 percent and use that money towards another road in the same contract.&#x201D;
	
	&#x201C;This year we&#x2019;re focused on housing, but&#x2026;we need to make sure we&#x2019;re paying attention to that as well,&#x201D; said Councilman DeDreanna Freeman, who has personally complained about the condition of her neighborhood&#x2019;s streets. 
	
	Councilman Charlie Reece has also reported such issues via NCDOT&#x2019;s online reporting system, and commended the efficiency of City Public Works employees in addressing concerns he has raised as a private citizen. 
	
	According to Johnson, it requires $8&#x2013;$10 million to adequately maintain the city&#x2019;s streets. 
	
	Marvin Williams, Public Works Director, indicated that some of the City&#x2019;s street maintenance costs are minimized by leasing more expensive equipment along with other municipalities. 
	
	&#x201C;Much of the work requires equipment that is not owned by the city&#x2026;[and] is shared by several municipalities in the Triangle.&#x201D; As a result, the City is able to save on the cost of ownership and maintenance, using certain equipment only when needed for larger-scale projects.</body>

			CARRBORO &#x2014; A fire broke out Monday evening at The Villages of Chapel Hill on Smith Level Road.
	
	A 911 call was placed at 5:08 p.m., after which emergency responders arrived on the scene within four minutes, and had the fire contained within 45 minutes.
	
	&#x201C;There were some people in the building, but we do not know the number at this time,&#x201D; said Carrboro Fire Department Chief Susanna Williams.  All the residents made it out of the building safely and no emergency personnel were injured, she added.
	
	Standing outside the flame-damaged L Building, Chief Williams went on to say, &#x201C;Of the sixteen units in the building, eight sustained heavy fire damage, and eight have smoke and water damage.&#x201D;
	
	The source of the fire has not been determined at this time, and the matter remains under investigation.
	
	Multiple units in addition to the Carrboro Fire Department responded, including the Chapel Hill, North Chatham and White Cross Fire Departments, as well as the Carrboro Police Department, South Orange Rescue Squad, Orange County Transit, and The Red Cross. 
	
	&#x201C;We have an automatic dispatch system that responds to fires, but in this case, we did call for additional services,&#x201D; said Chief Williams. 
	
	The Villages of Chapel Hill is located at 500 Smith Level Rd. in Carrboro.  This story will be updated as additional details become available.&#xD;

    <title>Fire at The Villages Was Accidental, Say Investigators</title>
    <subhead>Exhaust Fan Sparked Blaze That Displaced Dozens</subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>CARRBORO&#x2014;The source of Monday night's fire that displaced dozens of individuals at The Villages of Chapel Hill and caused an estimated $500,000 in damages has been discovered, according to Carrboro Fire Chief Susanna Williams.
	
	"The fire has been ruled accidental with the point of origin being an exhaust fan," said Williams. "The building has since been condemned, and a total of 21 units were affected."
	
	The Orange County Fire Marshal's office and the State Bureau of Investigation conducted the investigation into Tuesday. The report stated that the building was not equipped with residential fire sprinklers. Sprinkler systems are required in North Carolina for apartment buildings built after 2006.
	
	The fire was first reported at 5:08 PM Monday, when witnesses noticed smoke and flames billowing from the second story of apartment building L. Emergency responders were on the scene minutes later and had the fire contained within 45 minutes.
	
	Carrboro Police knocked on doors to ensure that all residents made it out of the building, and rescued one dog. Two cats that were unaccounted for Monday night have since been found. No civilians or firefighters were injured.
	
	"Due to the cold temperatures and rain, we requested Chapel Hill Transit to send a bus for the residents to have a dry place to stay warm," said Chief Williams, adding that many of the resident's personal vehicles were blocked by fire engines and other emergency equipment.
	
	"[Multiple] units were affected," said Vicki LaBelle, executive director of the American Red Cross of Central North Carolina. According to LaBelle, many of the homes are now uninhabitable.
	
	Several families were not at home when the fire occurred. The Red Cross met with all the individuals who were at home, and assisted nine people from four of the units involved.
	
	"There were two families and two individuals for whom we provided emergency lodging and financial assistance, because they walked out of their apartments with very little," said LaBelle.
	
	According to Chief Williams, firefighters spent several hours Monday night putting out "hot spots," small fires. "We went over it with a fine-toothed comb to make sure it was all extinguished," she said.
	
	"Case workers on the scene met with the landlord, who said there are 10 units that are immediately available for those displaced by the fire," LaBelle said. "We left our contact information behind so that, as other residents return home, they can contact us for further assistance."</body>

    <title>Brilliant Wallflower: Josh Moore in the Town of Carrboro</title>
    <subhead></subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>&#xD;
		
		
		
		
		&#xD;
			&#xD;
		CARRBORO&#x2014;You get an overwhelming feeling of d&#xE9;j&#xE0; vu in the presence of Josh Moore. You know him from somewhere. People in this town will tell you he&#x2019;s famous. That&#x2019;s not quite it, though; there&#x2019;s something ethereal about Josh Moore. 
	
	He is a bit of a wallflower in Carrboro, a town where musicians tend to stop and take a breather on the road to making something of themselves, and some forget they ever wanted to leave. It&#x2019;s the sort of place where a person ends up daydreaming about something big that was once desired. 
	
	At 33 years old, Moore&#x2019;s got an oddball career history for a young Carrboro musician. This town of 22,000 and the university town next door have been an East Coast stopover on the early roadmap of many successful bands. 
	
	Moore&#x2019;s career began in such a group&#x2014;Beloved, the band out of Kernersville whose blend of melody and hardcore energy gained a devoted national following and a run on the Christian rock festival circuit. 
	
	Many people in town have probably known him for years as the guy making their coffee at Open Eye Caf&#xE9;, though he is known by many of the Triangle music scene&#x2019;s brightest stars as a friend, collaborator, and fellow luminary.
	
	Many fans of Moore&#x2019;s music may have discovered him serendipitously, during or after the days of Beloved. During the band&#x2019;s lifetime, Beloved caught a wave of label interest in a surge of indie-  and Christian-hardcore music that surged in the southeast, bands like Norma Jean, Underoath, Dead Poetic, and Cool Hand Luke.
	
	Takehold Records, a Birmingham, Ala.-based record label, was acquired by Seattle-based Tooth &amp;amp; Nail Records while signing Beloved, which was eventually moved to the bigger label&#x2019;s division Solid State Records. Producer &#x201C;GGGarth&#x201D; Richardson took an interest. 
	
	&#x201C;I caught a demo of [Beloved] that I picked up from God-knows-where,&#x201D; said Josh Travitzky of Indio, California. Travitzky has been a fan since 2001. &#x201C;They all had a desire to make a positive impact with their music&#x2026;the guys were real and relatable back then, and now,&#x201D; Walker said. &#x201C;I&#x2019;ve been listening to Beloved for at least 15 to 20 years.&#x201D;
	
	The band broke up in 2005, initiating a period of relative career inactivity and Moore&#x2019;s eventual shift from hardcore to a folkier style.
	
	During those years, Moore moved to Carrboro, wanting to try something new. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s just in my nature to want to do something different,&#x201D; Moore said. &#x201C;You know, it&#x2019;s like passionate relationships. There&#x2019;s that idea that people have a type of person they&#x2019;re attracted to&#x2026;anything you&#x2019;re looking for, whether it&#x2019;s a partner or if it&#x2019;s music, I&#x2019;ve always been intrigued by something new, something I didn&#x2019;t even know I wanted, something that would come my way.&#x201D;
	
	The change of place corresponded to a shift in his musical geograpy. &#x201C;Moving to Carrboro was definitely a shift for me,&#x201D; Moore recollected in August, 2017, on-air to WUNC&#x2019;s Eric Hodge; &#x201C;I started listening to singer-songwriters, and folk music I guess changed my perceptions and conceptions of what music is.&#x201D; 
	
	A young man in his twenties, he was watched by labels as a &#x201C;known quantity&#x201D; with potential. Yet he brushed off a signing offer. On solo music, his lyrics took a dark turn. &#xD;

	
	&#xD;
&lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;Excuses wearing thin / And I don&#x2019;t even know where to begin / &lt;/span&gt;&#xD;

	
	&#x2019;Nothing slipped through the cracks in your lips / And that&#x2019;s all you had to say, it&#x2019;s all you had...
	
	&#x201C;We&#x2019;re only guilty if we have to hide from ourselves,&#x201D; Moore intoned on another track from those musically darker years after the days of Beloved. 
	
	That was then. His 2015 album, &#x201C;Parted Ways&#x201D;, draws on these things of the past, and casts them forth like a ripple in memory. 
	
	&#xD;
&lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;&#xD;
Come what may I&#x2019;ve seen it with my own two eyes / older and older each day / For tomorrow stakes its claim.&#xD;
&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;

	
	These days, he flies under the musical radar until he pops up somewhere with his guitar or plays the rare show at Cat&#x2019;s Cradle or the Local 506. There he is on albums by Mipso, or sharing their stage at Cat&#x2019;s Cradle in sold-out twin shows a couple years ago for the release of their album, &#x201C;Old Time Reverie&#x201D;. 
	
	Fitting, then, that when &#x201C;Parted Ways&#x201D; earned Rolling Stone&#x2019;s attention, it was on the magazine&#x2019;s list of &#x201C;30 Great Country Albums of 2015 You Probably Didn&#x2019;t Hear,&#x201D; tucked near the middle at No. 14.
	
	The music on &#x201C;Parted Ways&#x201D; is brighter, with layered instrumentation and lyrics with enlightened, been-to-the-mountaintop feeling: 
	
	&#xD;
&lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;&#xD;
So many days lie ahead on down the line / We can mend our parted ways, hey-y-y.&#xD;
&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;

	
	On those rare moments when he is to be discovered onstage, it might be in a covey of other quietly brilliant stars of the Triangle, a music scene with a rich tapestry of talent. People like Chessa Rich, Skylar Gudasz, Mark Simonsen of The Old Ceremony and members of Mount Moriah.
	
	Or with friends Emily Frantz and Andrew Marlin, whose duo Mandolin Orange streamlines with the delicate composing and prescient intonation of Moore&#x2019;s sound today. 
	
	Ronnie Walker, 41, of Kernersville, knows Moore further back than that. &#x201C;I was listening to Beloved, and when I met his dad (Mike) he told me that Josh was his son.&#x201D;
	
	&#x201C;I still listen to them because their music in my opinion is timeless,&#x201D; Walker said. &#x201C;It still speaks to me. . . and it takes me back to some of the best times in my life.&#x201D; 
	
	Travitzky reminisced about Beloved while listening to a music video uploaded to YouTube eight years ago. &#x201C;Bands like Beloved shaped my teenage years,&#x201D; he commented. &#x201C;Incredible musicians. Such a great energy as a band.&#x201D;
	
	&#x201C;It was the style of music,&#x201D; Travitzky said. &#x201C;I hadn&#x2019;t really heard anything that emotionally charged, and the balance between the screaming during the breakdowns and the transition to these beautiful melodies accompanied by clean vocals was very new to me.&#x201D;
	
	 &#x201C;We didn&#x2019;t have any animosity,&#x201D; Moore said about Beloved&#x2019;s disbanding. &#x201C;[Someone] in the band got married and we didn&#x2019;t want to replace him&#x2026;I was getting into different music that wasn&#x2019;t heavy. We said let&#x2019;s just call it a day.&#x201D;
	
	Moore came to Carrboro at the suggestion of some of his friends. Though his music is on the spectrum of country and folk, there&#x2019;s something unmistakably his that strikes a chord with fans.
	
	At 33, and already with a music career spanning two decades, it would be unusual if he didn&#x2019;t. 
	
	&#x201C;There were a number of years where I&#x2026;fed into a lot of anger and fear. I&#x2019;ve seen that&#x2026;I don&#x2019;t need it,&#x201D; he said. 
	
	&#x201C;I have the understanding that your ego operates on fear. That&#x2019;s how the mechanism of the ego and the human being is trying to protect itself&#x2014;it&#x2019;s based on fear, it&#x2019;s not based on&#x2014;&#x201D; Moore checked himself, then continued.  &#x201C;We have to learn other techniques. I don&#x2019;t try to feed into any fear or anger.&#x201D;
	
	&#x201C;At the end of the day, he&#x2019;s just a regular-ass dude like all of us, with struggles and stresses and trials and tribulations. He did a killer job of expressing his emotions musically,&#x201D; said Travitzky.
	
	As he takes the stage, it seems Moore has reached a personal Zen that is perhaps close to what people have always seen in his music.
	
	&#x201C;There are forces at work within a spectrum that move when you sing from a place of positivity, from the same place where someone who&#x2019;s singing from a place that&#x2019;s really dark&#x2026;I hope that&#x2019;s what&#x2019;s being emitted.&#x201D;&#xD;

    <title>Chapel Hill Marches for Past and Present on MLK Day</title>
    <subhead></subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>CHAPEL HILL&#x2014;The Chapel Hill&#x2013;Carrboro Branch of the NAACP held its annual Martin Luther King Jr. Day rally and march along Franklin Street on Monday morning despite temperatures dipping below 25 degrees Fahrenheit. Activists and spectators gathered just before 9 AM at the Peace and Justice Plaza.
	
	Efforts were made to warm up the crowd with call-and-response chants, and at least one person was giving out free hand warmers to anyone gloveless or shivering.
	
	An optimistic, if sobering, speech was delivered by African-American AIDS activist, journalist and community organizer Quinton Harper. He opened his address with a recitation of the late civil rights activist Pauli Murray&#x2019;s poem, &#x201C;Dark Testament: Verse 8.&#x201D; Harper&#x2019;s recitation left the crowd in a state of quiet reflection during the rest of his speech.
	
	Harper recited:
	
	Give me a song of hope /
	
	And a world where I can sing it. /
	
	Give me a song of faith /
	
	And a people to believe in it. /
	
	Give me a song of kindliness /
	
	And a country where I can live it. /
	
	When Chapel Hill Mayor Pam Hemminger stepped to the microphone, she announced the presence of several elected officials in the crowd, including Carrboro Board of Aldermen member Barbara Foushee, Orange County commissioners Penny Rich and Mark Marcoplos, and Chapel Hill&#x2013;Carrboro City School Board member Joal Broun.
	
	Speaking upon the continuing importance of Dr. King&#x2019;s legacy, Hemminger told the Sundial, &#x201C;In today&#x2019;s federal climate, we in Chapel Hill really do aspire to make sure everyone knows that they&#x2019;re welcome to be part of the community at an equal level.&#x201D;
	
	At 10 AM, the crowd began marching west on Franklin Street in the direction of First Baptist Church at 106 Roberson Street, where a reception and coffee social were given. Those wishing to warm up en route were treated to a hot cocoa and chai from a stand that a group of good Samaritans set up on the parade route.
	
	Among the marchers was Chapel Hill Town Council member Michael Parker, who felt moved to attend because of childhood memories of Dr. King&#x2019;s fight for equal justice, and as an acknowledgement that the fight is not over.
	
	&#x201C;I remember watching the March on Washington on my little black-and-white TV,&#x201D; Parker told the Sundial. &#x201C;Many people from my generation thought that, with the passing of the Voting Rights Act [of 1965], that the battle was won. But we&#x2019;ve come to realize the battle is far from won,&#x201D; Parker added.
	
	Valerie Foushee, state senator for Orange and Chatham Counties and a civil rights activist in her own right, made her appearance once the crowd passed Graham Street.
	
	When asked why such remembrance rallies still play such a large part in the celebration of Dr. King&#x2019;s life, Foushee stated firmly, &#x201C;We have to remind those people in leadership that this is what democracy truly looks like.&#x201D;
	
	Foushee continued, &#x201C;For towns like Chapel Hill, which is one of the biggest liberal bastions in the country, we&#x2019;re reminded every time we look at Silent Sam that there are still symbols of hate and oppression, and some people still feel intimidated.&#x201D;
	
	Foushee referred to the Silent Sam, nickname for the statue of a Confederate soldier on UNC&#x2019;s campus that memorializes the university&#x2019;s Civil War dead. The statue, built in 1913, is across the street a few hundred yards from the Peace and Justice Plaza. Its presence has been hotly debated over the past couple of years by students, alumni, faculty and residents.
	
	Once the march reached First Baptist Church, some activists mingled outside, a few smoking cigarettes and speaking to the press. But most people began filing into the church basement where more warm beverages and some cinnamon pastries awaited the frost-nipped attendees.
	
	UNC art professor Elin O&#x2019;Hara Slavick lingered by the front steps, taking in the scene. &#x201C;Rallies like these are always important, especially in the age of social media,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;I just think it&#x2019;s nice to be with people who think like you and want to bring about change. I think it&#x2019;s really important to stand together and speak out together.&#x201D;
	
	There can be no doubt that King&#x2019;s legacy means a great deal to many people.
	
	&#x201C;Justice, equality, fairness, are always goals for which we should strive. Until everybody is free, nobody is free,&#x201D; Foushee said. &#x201C;This is what we have to do&#x2014;not just keep the dream alive and preserve the legacy, but ensure that the dream can be realized.&#x201D;</body>

    <title>News Almanac: A Streak, a Curse, and a Dream</title>
    <subhead></subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>News and Notes for January 16, 2018: The Carolina Tar Heels have a stalwart history of winning at home against the visiting Clemson Tigers, SNL&#x2019;s language goes uncensored through WRAL and a march for Martin Luther King Jr. Day.
	
	"A Streak of Futility"
	
	The weight of history may not press so heavily on the UNC Tar Heels as it will upon the Clemson Tigers when the two college basketball teams meet in the Dean Dome Tuesday. Clemson&#x2019;s 0-and-58 record at Carolina is a winless streak that goes back to 1926.
	
	The NCAA notes on its web page that Clemson&#x2019;s 58 losses at Carolina have occurred &#x201C;over nine decades starting in 1926, on four different North Carolina home courts, through 14 Clemson coaches and 16 U.S. presidents.&#x201D;
	
	The Tar Heels (14&#x2013;4) must be wary of an ACC opponent with a better record (Clemson is 15&#x2013;2) and a historical chip on its shoulder that grows weightier with every meeting. Until the Tigers leave Chapel Hill with a win, should they ever do so, Clemson remains in the position of Fabrizzio in Stendhal&#x2019;s &#x201C;The Charterhouse of Parma,&#x201D; who escapes his cell because he spends more time thinking of ways to break free than his jailers spend thinking of ways to keep him locked up.
	
	Surely the Tigers are more spurred to break their winless record against Carolina than the Tar Heels will be provoked by UNC&#x2019;s perfect streak at home.
	
	What might motivate Carolina is the prospect of beating a ranked team with a better record in the ACC.
	
	&#x201C;Clemson seems like they could have a chance since the Tigers are playing some of their best basketball under Brad Brownell and the Tar Heels have had moments where their offense has struggled,&#x201D; writes Andy Katz, a correspondent for NCAA.com.
	
	The Tar Heels do indeed look vulnerable to motivated teams, after a Jan. 6 loss to Virginia and a close win on the road Saturday with a final-second Fighting Irish shot that pinballed on the rim but bounced away for a Carolina victory.

	&#x201C;Sorry About That, Lorne&#x201D;
	
	Remember back when when WRAL-TV had its finger on the hot-button during episodes of Saturday Night Live?
	
	Just over a year ago, the North Carolina NBC affiliate drew flak for censoring SNL host Dave Chappelle&#x2019;s monologue during the show&#x2019;s post-election episode of Nov. 12, 2016. After that move drew national attention and backlash from viewers, WRAL announced that it would be stepping down from its perch over its parent network's shoulder when it came to SNL.
	
	&#x201C;Under the new policy. . . WRAL viewers will get the same version of SNL approved by NBC&#x2014;even if that includes any of the 10 taboo words the station would delete during other broadcasts,&#x201D; the publication Broadcasting &amp; Cable noted at the time.
	
	Well, neither WRAL&#x2019;s engineer nor the NBC network jumped in time to catch actor Sam Rockwell&#x2019;s accidental F-bomb during a sketch on last weekend&#x2019;s episode. Rockwell, who hosted the episode starring musical guest Halsey, let slip the daddy of all four-letter words (or in this case, seven-letter gerunds) while playing &#x201C;Mr. Science&#x201D; during a sketch with Cecily Strong and Mike Day.
	
	Later in Saturday&#x2019;s episode, SNL Weekend Update co-host Colin Jost let fly the word &#x201C;shithole&#x201D;, which the censors also did not squelch, in reference to profanity the President of the United States was alleged to have used talking about unspecified African countries and Haiti, who have residents seeking to emigrate to the United States.

	"A Dream for Today"
	
	North Carolina celebrated the life of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. on Monday for the Federal holiday that honors the civil rights leader&#x2019;s birthday.
	
	King Jr. was born on January 15, 1929, in Atlanta to Martin L. King Sr. and Alberta Williams King. His father, a Baptist minister born in Stockbridge, Georgia, led Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta.
	
	King Jr. followed his father&#x2019;s example in his path to the ministry and in outspoken resistance to the segregated status quo. He graduated from a high school named for African-American scholar Booker T. Washington and entered Morehouse College as an 11th grader after passing the entrance exam. He graduated Morehouse in 1948 and earned a divinity degree from Crozer Theological Seminary.
	
	King Jr. earned his Ph.D. from Boston University in 1955, and that same year began participating in the Montgomery Bus Boycott. He organized the March on Washington, where he delivered his famous &#x201C;I Have a Dream&#x201D; speech in 1963. In 1964, Dr. King was awarded a Nobel Peace Prize. In 1965, he organized the marches from Selma to Montgomery. For the remainder of his life was a steadfast leader of the Civil Rights Movement and a champion for justice and equality in America&#x2019;s streets, schools, courts, public institutions and in the public square.
	
	When he was a child, King Jr. befriended a white boy whose father severed their friendship in accordance with the racist code of segregation that predominated in the South. In his speech on the National Mall in 1963, Dr. King said, &#x201C;I have a dream that one day in Alabama, with its vicious racists. . . one day right there in Alabama little black boys and black girls will he able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers.&#x201D;
	
	Fifty years after his death, Dr. King&#x2019;s life and work were celebrated across the nation and in North Carolina, with marches in Raleigh, Durham and Chapel Hill, where the Chapel Hill&#x2013;Carrboro Branch of the NAACP led a procession from Peace and Justice Plaza to the First Baptist Church of Chapel Hill at 106 North Roberson Street.
	
	UNC art professor Elin O&#x2019;Hara Slavick watched the ceremony from the steps of the church, and spoke to a Sundial reporter.
	
	&#x201C;Rallies like these are always important, especially in the age of social media,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;I just think it&#x2019;s nice to be with people who think like you and want to bring about change. I think it&#x2019;s really important to stand together and speak out together.&#x201D;

    <title>Fifty Years After 'Mountaintop,' Dr. King's Movement Marches On</title>
    <subhead>Carolinians Gather, Sing and March in Chapel Hill</subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>CHAPEL HILL&#x2014;Martin Luther King Jr. Day celebrations fell on a somber anniversary this year, for 2018 marks 50 years since the assassination of Dr. King.
	
	On April 4, 1968, the great civil rights leader, activist and minister was gunned down on a balcony in Memphis, Tennessee.
	
	As part of Monday&#x2019;s celebration of Dr. King&#x2019;s birthday, the Chapel Hill&#x2013;Carrboro Branch of the NAACP held a service in his honor at the First Baptist Church of Chapel Hill.
	
	The church was filled to capacity with a diverse audience. People of many faiths prayed together, held hands and sang songs of faith. People of all colors shook hands and hugged, saying, &#x201C;Peace be upon you.&#x201D;
	
	The UNC Gospel Choir and the Community Church Choir filled the room with gospel songs, joined by the voices of all who were present.
	
	At various times during the service, speakers suggested that America today is experiencing a time of disunity.
	
	In an opening prayer, Rev. Robert Campbell said, &#x201C;Bless us to be the repairer of the breach&#x2026;that we may embrace equality and love.&#x201D;
	
	Senator Valerie Foushee of the North Carolina General Assembly spoke of the political conditions that have pushed Americans apart, saying, &#x201C;We can see the cracks showing in the walls of our democracy.&#x201D;
	
	In 1968, giving the famous &#x201C;I Have Been to the Mountaintop&#x201D; speech in Memphis on what was to be the last night of his life, Dr. Martin Luther King offered a dour assessment of the state of the American union in his time.
	
	&#x201C;The world is all messed up,&#x201D; Dr. King said. &#x201C;The nation is sick. Trouble is in the land; confusion all around.&#x201D;
	
	That may not have been so strange a statement to describe the 1960s, a time when the country&#x2019;s deep divisions and unjust systems of racial segregation were being confronted.
	
	&#x201C;But I know, somehow, that only when it is dark enough can you see the stars,&#x201D; King said on April 3, 1968. The next day in Memphis, an assassin&#x2019;s bullet killed Dr. King at the Lorraine Motel.
	
	Today&#x2019;s politics have magnified divisions between Americans, some speakers suggested Monday at First Baptist Church of Chapel Hill.
	
	Pointing out that the result of the 2016 presidential election may have stirred some disengaged or disenfranchised Americans into activism, Foushee said. &#x201C;I urge you to resist and assist. Do not give up, though you may feel despair. And be not weary, for in due season we shall overcome.&#x201D;
	
	Chapel Hill-Carrboro NAACP branch president Anna Richards spoke at the podium of the day&#x2019;s chill and the many steps the movement has taken forward since the 1960s.
	
	&#x201C;It was cold out there today, but there were no dogs. It was cold out there today, but there were no water hoses. We have made progress, but do not be fooled. Throw everything that is holding you back overboard, and whatever you are doing&#x2026;do more.&#x201D;
	
	Rabbi Jen Feldman of Kehillah Synagogue gave a homily that presented the question, &#x201C;How do we know when there is enough light in the darkness?&#x201D;
	
	There is enough light when you can see the eyes and intentions of your brothers and sisters, Rabbi Feldman said.</body>

			CHAPEL HILL&#x2014;The world outdoors has been transformed into a snowy landscape after all-day Wednesday snowfall over the Piedmont, which finally let up in late evening.
	
	Snow began to fall in Chapel Hill Wednesday morning at around 7:30AM, and ceased over downtown Chapel Hill at around 9:45PM.
	
	As of Thursday, many of the area's secondary roads have not been cleared, and six inches or more of snow covers sidewalks, yards, roads and roofs. Snow accumulation in north Durham was reported to be more than 9 inches by Wednesday evening.&#xD;
		&#xD;

		&#xD;
					Durham Sheriff Mike Andrews told media Wednesday that the Durham County Sheriff's Department had responded to about 30 auto wrecks, to say nothing of vehicles that had been abandoned on the sides of roads, which Andrews said deputies were checking to make sure drivers and occupants had been able to safely remove themselves.

    <title>Shred for Music Ed: Local Bands Rock for Charity</title>
    <subhead>Music Teacher Schools Community on What It Means to Give Back</subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>&#xD;

			DURHAM&#x2014;Picturing the face of generosity, you probably don't imagine a metal band unloading their gear from the back of a conversion van.
	
	You probably don't picture Chris Hathcock, who wouldn't look out of place wearing all black and carrying a Gibson Flying V. With long hair and an intimidating beard, he looks a little like an extra in a Rob Zombie movie.
	
	Hathcock is a guitarist in The Reticent, a Durham-based metal band, and a band teacher at Charles E. Jordan High School in Durham.
	
	He and, his bandmates, plus three other bands, are playing a charity show at Motorco Music Hall on Friday, February 2 called Shred for Music Ed.
	
	The event, organized by Hathcock, is a charity drive to raise money for Jordan High School's band program.
	
	"Many of these bright students do not have the resources to be able to afford things like instruments or other prospective financial burdens that can accompany studying music," said Hathcock.
	
	Durham Public Schools website shows that nearly half of students receive free or reduced lunches&#x2014;48.66%, to be exact. Such statistics are ever present in Chris Hathcock's mind, and have been during his nine years as an educator.
	
	All of the bands on the bill have played together before, and a few are regular cohorts on the stage.
	
	"Poverty, lack of school funding, or other obstacles should not stand in the way of young people's opportunity to be enriched through music study," he said. "This event&#x2026;is my attempt to do what I can as a performer for these students."
	
	The North Carolina bands on the bill &#x2013; including Undrask, from Greensboro, Kairos., from Charlotte, and A Light Divided, from Winston-Salem &#x2013; are traveling to perform at their own expense and donating all proceeds from ticket sales to cover the cost of providing Jordan High School band students with instruments.&#xD;

		&#xD;
					Motorco Music Hall, a Durham rock venue at the corner of Gear Street and Riggsbee Avenue, boasts a 450-person capacity. According to Hathcock, at $10.75 per ticket, 30 tickets sold will cover the venue's expenses. Everything else goes straight to the students of Jordan High. An estimated 100 tickets would enable the bands to reach their fundraising goal.
	
	The Reticent is also donating proceeds from merchandise sales, and Steven Wynn from Undrask has generously donated an Ibanez bass which will be raffled during the show.
	
	Although a lot of club bands have difficulty covering their expenses, let alone making a profit, The Reticent does quite a bit of charity work. In November, The Reticent performed at the Rock N Rescue Music Festival, with proceeds benefiting several animal rescue charities.
	
	The band's 2016 album, "On the Eve of a Goodbye", was inspired by a close friend whom Hathcock lost to suicide, and several shows during its tour were performed with proceeds benefiting suicide prevention.
	
	The picture of humility, Hathcock didn't mention during an interview that he was nominated for the Grammy Music Educator Award for 2017.
	
	By the same stroke, Hathcock said he hopes that what he and the other bands are doing sets an example for students.
	
	"By showcasing bands that use music to express themselves and enrich their lives not just for a grade or a paycheck, we also demonstrate to these students how music can be a lifelong pursuit or a lifelong companion to aid them as they navigate this world," Hathcock said.
	
	"It doesn't make us any money, but...making music for a purpose always means more than making music for a paycheck."&#xD;

    <title>News Almanac: Amazon Deals Raleigh In</title>
    <subhead></subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>JAN. 20&#x2014;Raleigh has survived a big elimination round to be included among the final 20 North American cities being considered by Amazon for the company&#x2019;s second headquarters.
	
	The Internet selling and shipping giant, which ranks among the biggest U.S. companies (higher on the list than Coca-Cola or Pepsico) announced last year it was accepting proposals from cities and municipalities through Oct. 19, 2017.
	
	Amazon&#x2019;s highly publicized search for its &#x201C;HQ2&#x201D; launched cities and regional planning groups across the country into a bidding process the media has covered as though it were a nationwide bachelor auction.
	
	Raleigh was among 238 cities that wooed Amazon with proposals. Executive director Ryan Combs of the Research Triangle Partnership, which submitted a proposal on behalf of Wake County, described the search as &#x201C;one of the biggest business sweepstakes in a generation&#x201D; to the publication VentureBeat.
	
	Amazon&#x2019;s HQ2 will be a &#x201C;full equal&#x201D; of the company&#x2019;s current headquarters in Seattle, according to the company. Amazon said it expects to put $5 billion into developing the campus, which it said will bring as many as 50,000 jobs with an average total annual compensation of more than $100,000.
	
	Charlotte was eliminated with 217 other municipalities that submitted a proposal. Sixteen out of the 20 cities to make the cut were east of the Mississippi River. Other cities along the Atlantic seaboard that made it through this selection round include New York, Boston, Pittsburgh and Miami.
	
	Wolfpack Hunts Near Home
	
	After bucking a Duke basketball team currently ranked No. 5 in the AP poll and splitting versus Clemson (win, 78-77) and Virginia (loss, 51-68), NC State has made a hunting ground of its ACC neighborhood this January, beating Wake Forest, 72-63.
	
	Omer Yurtseven scored 22 points for the Wolfpack, and Doral Moore had 10 rebounds and 15 points for Wake Forest. Abdul-Malik Abu started the game for N.C. State, but played only 13 minutes, scoring two points with no rebounds, one block and one assist.
	
	The unranked Wolfpack will stalk another AP-ranked ACC power, No. 25 Miami, Sunday on the Pack&#x2019;s home court at PNC Arena.
	
	Bundle up, It&#x2019;s Cold
	
	Temperatures sank into the teens this week as the Piedmont experienced several inches of snow, with close to a foot covering some areas.
	
	There are many strategies you can employ for keeping safe against frigid conditions, but here are a few essentials:
	
	&#xF0A7;	Keep your core (the middle of your body) warm and covered. &#x201C;Layer-up&#x201D; with extra clothing to insulate by slowing air exchange.
	
	&#xF0A7;	Cover any exposed skin. This is where your body loses heat fastest.
	
	&#xF0A7;	Cover your head: hats, hoods and earmuffs are recommended.
	
	&#xF0A7;	Go waterproof&#x2014;protect your feet from cold and slush. If you don&#x2019;t have good waterproof gear, you can put large kitchen bags over your socks to keep feet dry inside wet shoes and boots.
	
	&#xF0A7;	Protect your extremities &#x2013; fingers and toes are areas most vulnerable to frostbite.
	
	&#xF0A7;	Drink water, because hydration helps your body retain heat.
	
	&#xF0A7;	Coming in from the cold? Clothing layers insulate by limiting air exchange, and cold air from outside can become trapped in the clothing. Shed your coat and sweater to expose your body to warmer indoor air.
	
	&#xF0A7;	Cold weather becomes more dangerous when you expose yourself to the elements. Limit this possibility by making trips outdoors only when necessary. Avoid driving an untrustworthy vehicle and use well-traveled roads that have been cleared of snow and ice.
	
	Tar Heels Dig-In
	
	The Carolina Tar Heels defended the home court for a record 59th time Tuesday night against Clemson, which owns a losing streak for the basketball record books when they play at UNC.
	
	UNC&#x2019;s streak of wins at home against Clemson is the longest between two teams in college history.
	
	Despite their good shooting in a hard-fought game, the Tigers sustained their streak fo futility against the Tar Heels in Tuesday&#x2019;s 79-87 defeat.
	
	Clemson&#x2019;s Marcquise Reed scored 21, Shelton Mitchell scored 18, and Elijah Thomas scored 16 as Clemson during one period in the second half made sixteen straight shots from the field, though Clemson could not catch the Tar Heels to fall to an 0-59 record at Carolina, a streak that began in 1926 and has bedeviled the Tigers on four different Carolina home courts.
	
	Roy Williams suffered another of his bouts of vertigo on his sideline at the Dean Dome, but was back in full-intensity mode a few moments later, pumping his fist on the sidelines as the two teams raced between goalposts in the second half.
	
	Cameron Johnson, the former Pittsburgh player who joined UNC as a graduate student in his final year of eligibility, shot with a hot hand Tuesday for 21 points, with six three-pointers on nine attempts. Joel Berry II scored 17 points and went a combined 13-for-13 for free-throws with fellow senior Theo Pinson (who was 8-for-8 from the line).
	
	Luke Maye had a relatively quiet night for numbers, but sustained a few stitches for a cut on his face in the thick of the fray, but returned to the game. The 6-foot-8 center is now averaging 17.8 points and 10.5 rebounds per game.
	
	Carolina basketball has tasted defeat at the hands of the Tigers, in ACC tournament play in 1972 and on Clemson&#x2019;s home court. But at Carolina, the Tigers own a perfect rate of failure, an all-time record that is still active. Runner-up on the list goes to Brown&#x2019;s streak of futility at Princeton, a 52-game losing streak that lasted from 1929 until 2002.
	
	The result brings the Tar Heels (15-4) and Tigers (15-3) even at matching conference records of 4-2. The Tar Heels play their next game Saturday at 2PM against Georgia Tech in the Dean Dome.</body>

    <title>Freeze Heightens Dangers of Homelessness</title>
    <subhead>"Beautiful but Cold" Says Homeless Couple</subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>CHAPEL HILL&#x2014;Through the windows of a heated home, the winter storm that crossed North Carolina last week was a pleasure to many who enjoyed the rare sight from indoors, with work and school canceled.
	
	But what about people who woke up in their cars, or wrapped in a sleeping bag outside? The recent winter storm brought between six inches and a foot of snow, with night temperatures dropping into the lower teens and a wind chill factor even colder.
	
	On the streets and in the woods, those who are homeless faced the dangerous cold and stinging snow with blankets, coats and&#x2014;for some&#x2014;tents. County shelters open up when outside temperatures become dangerously frigid.
	
	April Porter and her husband Timothy Alston have been living in their car in Chapel Hill with their much-loved cat, Junior.
	
	They can often be seen on Franklin Street with Junior by their side and a cardboard sign. They never ask for anything out loud, preferring to greet and compliment those who pass by.
	
	&#x201C;We came up from Hurricane Irma four and a half months or so ago, and had truck problems,&#x201D; said Porter. &#x201C;Between that and the cost of housing around here&#x2026;we ended up living out of our car.&#x201D;
	
	After a long search, Porter is now working part-time at a local hotel, but they do not make enough for a security deposit and, if required, first and last month&#x2019;s rent. They are focusing on survival, jumping each new hurdle as it comes.
	
	They do not stay in the area shelters, due to Junior; pets in general are not allowed.
	
	&#x201C;We did not have to suffer in the cold [during the last cold snap] because our church set us up,&#x201D; said Porter. &#x201C;The hotel where I work helped us out, too.&#x201D;
	
	Surveys indicate there may be as many as 270 homeless men, women and children in Orange County at any given time, according to statistics provided by the Inter-Faith Council of Social Service.
	
	&#x201C;We are typically at capacity for our regular beds,&#x201D; said Rex Mercer, program manager at IFC Women and Children's Shelter. &#x201C;We do have three additional cots for inclement weather. We have 14 beds for single women and 10 rooms for families.&#x201D;
	
	&#x201C;It is first come, first served for the single women's beds and the family rooms are on a waiting list. If we are at capacity, we do try to reach out to other shelters in Durham and Alamance.&#x201D;
	
	&#x201C;We do see more people come in when it is in the teens,&#x201D; said IFC Residential Services Director Stephanie Kilpatrick. &#x201C;The temperatures being so low for so long is not something we are used to in this area and it puts more people at risk who have nowhere to go or to sleep.&#x201D;
	
	Orange County has two homeless shelters. The men's shelter has 52 beds and 17 extra cots for extreme weather, and the women&#x2019;s and children&#x2019;s shelter has 14 beds for single women, 10 rooms for families, and three emergency cots.
	
	&#x201C;When the weather is like this, we do whatever we can and then we have to refer them to other counties. We would gladly expand our capacity if we had the funds to do so. It is a real need,&#x201D; Kilpatrick added.
	
	Relocation to facilities in a different county can often be a challenge at times when public transit systems are shut down due to inclement winter weather, or when individuals have part-time jobs they must get to the next day.
	
	&#x201C;During a snow or ice storm, transportation is often a problem with the city busses down and conditions too hostile to walk several miles to a shelter,&#x201D; said Alston.
	
	Having a job today might not be enough to get out of homelessness; in the small group of homeless people gathered on Franklin Street including Alston and Porter, two people worked at local donut shops, one at an area pizzeria and another at a local hotel.
	
	Bus fare and referrals to other counties&#x2019; shelters are available during inclement weather for those remaining. That is, if they come and if the busses are running. Even if they have to walk to work through the snow, they cannot afford to lose employment.
	
	Alston said, &#x201C;There needs to be a lot more beds at the male and female shelters. There are people in the camps [homeless camp sites or tent cities] all over the county, and others are sleeping under cardboard between HVAC units and in dumpsters.&#x201D;
	
	Many people do not make their homelessness visible to others, holding day jobs and returning to a car, a camp or a shelter, or staying from place to place for as long as circumstances allow.
	
	Porter and Alston are some of the more visible homeless people on Franklin Street, and people stop often to pet Junior and converse with his owners.
	
	&#x201C;Everyone loves Junior.&#x201D; Alston smiled. &#x201C;One of them even bought a cat sweater for him.&#x201D; The two pointed out that there were places to take a break from the freezing cold, as other homeless individuals chimed in.
	
	&#x201C;In the morning, you can go to McDonalds and buy a 75-cent coffee, and they won&#x2019;t run you off,&#x201D; said Alston. &#x201C;You can park at Walmart and go in for a while, and then you have the IFC Community Kitchen on Rosemary. They have lunch and dinner during the week and one meal a day on weekends.&#x201D;
	
	&#x201C;And St. Joseph&#x2019;s at 3:30,&#x201D; added a homeless man who did not want to share his name, referring to St. Joseph Christian Methodist Church at 510 W. Rosemary St.
	
	They also mentioned Amity United Methodist Church's clothes closet and Love Chapel Hill Church, which operates out of the Varsity Theatre, serving coffee and bagels and handing out clothes on Sunday mornings.
	
	Alston and Porter pointed out that there are some restaurants that will help a lot of homeless people if they are hungry, and if it is too cold they will let them come in and warm up.
	
	&#x201C;Officer Kramer with the Chapel Hill Police Department comes around and gives blankets, hats and coats to the homeless,&#x201D; said Alston.
	
	&#x201C;Officer Kramer gave me these pants!&#x201D; said a beaming homeless man named David (who did not wish to give his full name) as he kicked up his legs to show the blue pants he was wearing.
	
	Sheltering in a car provides safety from exposure, but car ownership can present complications for those without a place to park.
	
	&#x201C;There is a big problem with where to park if you are homeless and have a car,&#x201D; said Alston. &#x201C;Tows are $180, and after the first 24 hours it is $45 dollars a day.&#x201D; One time, Junior was in the vehicle when it was towed away.
	
	&#x201C;We were allowed to go and get Junior and some of our belongings,&#x201D; Alston said. &#x201C;They were really nice that way.&#x201D;
	
	But vehicle registration, inspections and tows have buried the couple in a deeper financial hole.
	
	During the storm, which dumped half a foot of snow or more over the Triangle, the couple and their cat were able to spend the three nights indoors. &#x201C;It was cold but beautiful.&#x201D;
	
	James Earl Craig, a homeless man who begged for change on West Franklin Street, was found outside in Chapel Hill and was pronounced dead at UNC Hospital on December 16. On the night of his death, the temperature had fallen below freezing.
	
	The Piedmont Sundial has contacted Orange County and UNC Hospitals seeking official cause of death for Craig, who during the last few years of his life spent many days and nights panhandling in the block of store fronts between Chapel Hill Cleaners and Mellow Mushroom.
	
	Freezing outside is a rare occurrence in Orange County, but one person who stopped to talk on Franklin Street snow recalled several cases of death from the cold in Virginia.
	
	&#x201C;Many don't go to the shelters for several different reasons. They face the extreme temperatures in the streets or in camps in the woods,&#x201D; said Mary Mooney, a visitor to Chapel Hill from Virginia who stopped to give some money to Porter and Alston on Franklin Street. &#x201C;A few years back four or five died in Newport News and Virginia Beach. A couple died under trees as they slept, one died in a dumpster and another camping out on the beach.&#x201D;
	
	Porter and Alston said there are many reasons why individuals do not seek out the shelters. Certain entries on a criminal record, fighting and &#x201C;acting out&#x201D; can cause an individual to be banned. Some people &#x201C;hunker down and don't come out until the weather clears.&#x201D;
	
	Due to having their own vehicle and knowing the homeless community, the couple is often able to distribute food and clothing to individuals in camps or otherwise off the beaten path.
	
	&#x201C;Churches, kitchens and individuals like Officer Kramer will give us extra blankets and coats because they know we redistribute it to others,&#x201D; said Porter.
	
	&#x201C;We basically do it from the heart,&#x201D; said Alston &#x201C;But as much as we give, the community gives back to us.&#x201D;
	
	With the weather as such, the couple had not heard back from others who spent the past few nights outside.
	
	&#x201C;We were the only ones out in the snow day before yesterday,&#x201D; Alston said. &#x201C;We haven&#x2019;t heard anything yet.&#x201D;</body>

    <title>Mobile Park Residents Protest Gentrification</title>
    <subhead>Chapel Hill Town Council Hears Objections to Proposed Lakeview Redevelopment</subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>CHAPEL HILL&#x2014;The Chapel Hill Town Council met in front of a packed house this Wednesday night for a public hearing concerning the future of the Lakeview mobile home complex located on Weaver Dairy Road. The neighborhood&#x2019;s current residents are scheduled to be cleared from the site by the summer of 2019 to make room for new real estate developments as the painful process of gentrification continues in parts of Orange County.
	
	The proposed development project&#x2019;s applicant, the architecture and engineering firm Coulter Jewell Thames, were at the meeting to pitch the construction of Hanover, a 400,000-square-foot mixed-use &#x201C;rental community.&#x201D; The site structures would include 303 apartments, 18 townhomes and 387 parking spaces.
	
	It would cause removal of 33 mobile homes at Lakeview, a large percentage of which belong to Chapel Hill&#x2019;s Hispanic community.
	
	The first hour and a half of the meeting, which addressed applications for two special use permits and the authorization of a process contract enabling the hiring of a new town manager, ran smoothly with little public input. Then Mayor Pam Hemminger introduced the Hanover concept plan review, and in a synchronized display of polite civil disobedience, more than two thirds of the seated audience got to their feet and displayed placards indicating exactly who in attendance would be at risk of displacement.
	
	Representing Coulter Jewell Thames was property management director Bo Buchanan. He argued that the proposed plan would take the needs of the Lakeview residents into consideration, and pointed to a relocation lump sum stipend of $75,000 (roughly $2000 per family), as well as Hanover&#x2019;s own &#x201C;affordable housing&#x201D; units, as evidence.
	
	Buchanan then expressed his belief that &#x201C;the residents of Lakeview Mobile Homes will get a better deal through this process&#x201D; than if the Council rejects the plan. When asked by the Sundial to clarify this point and explain what the alternatives might be, Buchanan refused to respond.
	
	When it came time for public comment, a Spanish language interpreter was introduced, as 8 of the 19 individuals on the long list of speakers who signed up were not able to address the Council in English. A large number of community members elected to represent their neighborhood.
	
	These Lakeview residents submitted personal pleas for the council to reconsider the plan entirely and to contemplate the consequences to them of being uprooted. Elderly resident Alberto Franco uttered one particularly cutting phrase through the interpreter: &#x201C;If you have to relocate us, treat us like human beings!&#x201D;
	
	Throughout much of the proceedings, spectators murmured with restless energy and shouted calls of support to friends and family when they approached the lectern. The room went quiet, however, when elementary school student Leia Hernandez tearfully explained to the Council members, who appeared attentive and sensitive to the high stakes, that she didn&#x2019;t wish to &#x201C;lose her school or her friends&#x201D; who were all &#x201C;really happy to be [living at Lakeview].&#x201D;
	
	When the roster of speakers was cleared, Mayor Pam Hemminger and each council member directly addressed their constituents and attempted to clarify the reality the Council saw. Municipal governments cannot make decisions about land use for the property owner, and the property owner is the selling party; any town official&#x2019;s power to extend help will always be legally subject to the developer&#x2019;s interests.
	
	When Mayor Pro Tem Jessica Anderson addressed the room, she began by plainly stating, &#x201C;If I thought I could help you by making this development go away, then you would have my vote, but I don&#x2019;t think that&#x2019;s what&#x2019;s going to happen.&#x201D;
	
	Choking back tears of her own, she continued, &#x201C;If we don&#x2019;t move forward with [the development], I&#x2019;m afraid that the person who owns this land will get rid of you very quickly so they won&#x2019;t have to deal with you anymore.&#x201D;
	
	Council Member Michael Parker issued a personal apology to Lakeview residents for not having more effective, timelier strategies in place.
	
	&#x201C;We&#x2019;ve known for a while that our trailer parks land was becoming too valuable to resist,&#x201D; Parker said. &#x201C;We should have had a plan, but we didn&#x2019;t.&#x201D;
	
	UNC undergraduate Rubi Franco, who spent her childhood and adolescence in the Lakeview community, told the Sundial that she &#x201C;felt a lot worse about things going into the meeting than coming out of it.&#x201D; She believes the Council members are sincere in their efforts to mitigate the problem, and hopes &#x201C;that the developers take all the comments into consideration, because they know that many of us are low-income families.&#x201D;
	
	Local pediatrician and former Chapel Hill&#x2013;Carrboro City School Board candidate Kim Talikoff gave one of the more forceful three-minute speeches to the Council. When asked by the Sundial about her concerns moving forward, she responded by emphasizing the responsibility of broader community engagement on the part of Chapel Hill and the development representatives.
	
	&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know if many people in the town really realize that we are on the cusp of evicting hundreds of families that we care about and need&#x2014;not from an economic point of view, but from a human point of view,&#x201D; Talikoff said.
	
	Council Member Donna Bell, who spoke to the Sundial via phone Thursday morning, expressed frustration with the complexities and competing interests at play, but maintained an overall sense of optimism. She points to one possible solution that might meet the needs of the Lakeview residents as well as allow the landowner to move forward with the Hanover project. The idea, originally proposed by Orange County Commissioner Barry Jacobs, is the conversion of a section of publicly owned park land located on Millhouse Road into low-income housing for any resident forced out of the mobile home park, as well as other low-income families in the area.
	
	&#x201C;I think that if we were able to make [the purchase of park land] possible, then we should be able to do the same to provide folks homes and protect their communities,&#x201D; Bell said.
	
	When the hearing closed, the crowd filtered out of the chambers and gathered in small groups around the parking lot. There was a lot of hugging and crying and nervous laughter as attendees took stock of where the battle now stands, many still clutching their signs reading &#x201C;Lakeview Is My Home.&#x201D;</body>

    <title>In a Clearing Near His Camp, Man's Humble Generosity Remembered</title>
    <subhead>Stephen Taylor Recalled As Local Inspiration</subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>CHAPEL HILL&#x2014;On Last Friday afternoon, a clearing in the woods at Homestead Park was dotted with floating white balloons and music as multiple individuals stepped up to talk, sing or read poetry. They were remembering Louisiana native and long-time Chapel Hill resident Stephen Daniel Taylor. He was a happy and generous yet humble man who had touched many lives in Orange County.
	
	Taylor, whom many called Stevo, worked part-time at a tobacco shop on Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard, frequented the Food Lion and Joe Van Gogh coffee shop a few miles north, and spent most of his time sharing his infectious smile and anything else he had with others. He also lived in a tent in the woods near MLK. He was homeless, yet would buy others a cup of coffee, give away his last few dollars to someone in need and lend a caring ear. He was 56 years old.
	
	On January 16 at approximately 9:30 PM, Taylor was struck by a car and killed between 1620 Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard and Westminster Drive.
	
	&#x201C;He was just crossing the street to his campsite,&#x201D; said friend Zoe Watts.
	
	As of January 30, the collision is still under investigation, and there is no word to date on any potential charges.
	
	More and more people showed up for his memorial, including fellow homeless friends, Inter-Faith Council and Community Empowerment Fund staff members, Food Lion and coffee shop employees and other friends gather in his honor.
	
	Local artist and writer Tom Hallman opened the ceremony. &#x201C;We all loved Steve. How could you not? He would take bread from the shelter and feed the birds,&#x201D; Hallman said with a smile. &#x201C;He had names for them all and was incredibly smart... You couldn't help but love him... His life was long and hard, but he would be pleased to see all who came out to remember him.&#x201D;
	
	Former Inter-Faith Council nurse Teresa Rogers and local resident Annie, who did not wish to share her last name, both read poems in his honor and spoke of their friendship and the blessing he had been in their lives.
	
	&#x201C;I used to call him the music man and still see him in my eyes,&#x201D; Annie read from her poem. &#x201C;Sometimes when you played your music I would dance and you loved it. You had a heart like an angel child...and a brave night. I miss you.&#x201D;
	
	Rogers read a poem from the collection &#x201C;Prayers of Honoring&#x201D; by Pixie Lighthorse. She said, &#x201C;I was pretty lucky to work at a place where he could come and talk to me. I was lucky to know him, and he would often make me smile.&#x201D;
	
	The stories and comments started painting a picture of who Steve Taylor was.
	
	&#x201C;I used to call him Stevie Wonder and he would say, 'I wonder.' He made an impact on my life and made me feel like what I did was worthwhile. If he was at the shelter and could not find soap and I brought some to him, he would say, 'You are a good man.'&#x201D; &#x2013; LaBrone Wade, of IFC&#x2019;s Community House
	
	&#x201C;He touched my life, and everybody here...he touched their lives too.&#x201D; &#x2013; Fred, close friend
	
	&#x201C;Steve showed me that homeless people are just like you and me or anybody else...they are just down on their luck. He forever changed my opinion and I loved him like a brother.&#x201D; &#x2013; Mary Anne, IFC staff
	
	&#x201C;He was a music lover. He loved it all&#x2014;electric, rock, folk&#x2014;everything. If a song made me cry he would hug me. He was a true survivor and a true soldier, and I love him.&#x201D; &#x2013; Annie, close friend.
	
	&#x201C;The only time I met Stevo was when Tim and I were sitting on the street, and a lady was praying with us and had given us some bibles. And Steve went and bought her a cup of coffee and handed it to her. That was how he was.&#x201D; &#x2013; April Porter, acquaintance
	
	&#x201C;Steve was a great guy. He would always come in and stay till closing. He made my day when he came in. The last time I saw him, I was working at the cash register and he said, 'What's up!', and I said it back, and we smiled. I was shocked when I heard the news.&#x201D; &#x2013; Shanequa Brittian, Food Lion
	
	Others spoke of how Taylor would have wanted this memorial to be a happy exchange and laughed to hear stories that epitomized his characteristic good humor.
	
	Charlotte native Nick VonKallist, now 24 years old, was looking for any spot on the street to sleep when he first met Taylor.
	
	&#x201C;I got here last year when it was still warm, but was soon homeless in the winter. I was living in an abandoned building when the police found me and said that if they found me here again they would have to press charges... I was always having to move,&#x201D; said VonKallist. &#x201C;I later saw Steve and he asked me how I was doing and I told him. He said that he had an extra sleeping bag and room in his tent. He took me in out of the cold.&#x201D;
	
	VonKallist was no longer alone, the first time he hadn&#x2019;t been since his parents had died. He didn't have just a tent to stay in, but, eventually, a home.
	
	&#x201C;We would stay up late talking and sharing each other's food. If he ever had more he would share it with me&#x2014;money, blankets, coats or food,&#x201D; VonKallist said. &#x201C;He had a big heart. Anything and everything he had, he would give away if someone needed it.&#x201D;
	
	VonKallist described Taylor as a great storyteller and blues lover. They would share childhood stories and Taylor would talk of places he had traveled to over the years.
	
	&#x201C;He loved the blues, the really old stuff, and felt a lot, and always cared about people,&#x201D; said VonKallist. His face flushed and tears ran down his face. &#x201C;He was just a wonderful person.&#x201D; VonKallist soon walked down a path in the park and did not return.
	
	He was not the first to cry at the service Friday. The stories continued in Homewstead park near the woods where Taylor had lived. Chapel Hill artist and writer Michele Natalie played a soulful melody on a Native American flute as others played chimes, and then everyone joined in to sing &#x201C;Lean on Me&#x201D; by Bill Withers.
	
	At the end of the memorial, Hallman, who had opened, said a few words on being your brother's keeper. Then the group walked out to the athletic field, said a prayer and released the white balloons into the Carolina blue sky.
	
	A homeless friend said, &#x201C;Stevo would not want us to say goodbye. He would just want us to say, 'See ya later.'&#x201D;</body>

    <title>Unlocking DNA's Shapeshifting Mysteries</title>
    <subhead></subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>DURHAM&#x2014;A Duke University biochemist has discovered patterns to genetic mutation in the shapeshifting of DNA.
	
	Dr. Hashim Al-Hashimi, Duke biochemist and director of the Al-Hashimi Lab on campus, has been probing human DNA for its secrets for years alongside a team of dedicated university students and colleagues. They have recently confirmed particles shapeshift during DNA's production, and that this transformation happens in a predictable sequence. These findings and more were published on February 1 in the academic journal "Nature".
	
	The article, titled "Dynamic Basis of dG-dT Misincorporation via Tautomerization and Ionization", could mark a dramatic evolution in science's understanding of genetics, and may lead to new ways of research into cancer treatment.
	
	The mystery of DNA's mutation is as deep as our knowledge of the material itself. James Watson co-published his legendary paper on the structure of DNA with Francis Crick in 1953, on work for which he later won the Nobel Prize. The years of research preceding its debut were frustrating, because Watson just wasn't getting the results he knew to be correct in his search for the substance's true shape. But he was coming close enough, often enough, that he hypothesized that an invisible shift in physical dimensions must be occurring. Now, Dr. Al-Hashimi's team, upon examination of DNA's constituent parts at the subatomic level, have confirmed this shifting is indeed taking place.
	
	Genes are the biological information that make us who we are as individuals and as members of a species. The notion that DNA acts as their carrier has been established since the mid-1950s. Further study proved gene replication to be more precise and accurate than expected. But the machine is not perfect, and when errors happen through mutation, we pay the price in the form of cancer and genetic abnormalities.
	
	Therefore, getting a firm grasp on the mechanics of mutation has been the goal of many biochemists for much of the past 30 years.
	
	Dr. Al-Hashimi put it this way: "The question has always been, how does DNA mutation occur, and...what makes it only occur at a given frequency?"
	
	Enzymes known as polymerase synthesize DNA in part by physically identifying bases in a strand and pairing each one with the complementary base to create the other side of the double helix (the spiral staircase shape DNA takes). When a polymerase identifies a mistake in the chain of base pairings, it moves back one base pair, and then delete the base that doesn't match.
	
	However, scientists have calculated that polymerases commit an error around roughly every 10,000 bases. Whenever the body fails to fix such a genetic typo, the error is then passed on as a mutation. Since the human body is made of billions of cells that can divide and replicate several times a day, mutations can accumulate relatively quickly.
	
	"How does something like that slip by the system's defenses?" asks Dr. Al-Hashimi. "What we discovered is that the mutated DNA base can flicker and transition into a new shape that looks like the non-mutated shape... It's both a chemical and structural shift."
	
	That particular discovery was published in 2015 by Al-Hashimi, Isaac Kimsey, Katja Petzold and others, but much of the data collected at the time was not easy to interpret. What they did figure out was that these atomic rearrangements presented themselves in two distinct types, which the team labeled "tautomeric" or "anionic."
	
	These spontaneous movements of particles are presenting themselves in chronological patterns, making the case against complete entropy.
	
	"The shapeshifting still happens stochastically [at random]. However, the frequency with which those shapeshifts happen can be sequenced, which suggests that the process itself isn't entirely random...and the mutations are built into the system," Al-Hashimi said, adding "certain parts of the DNA are more likely to shapeshift than others."
	
	"Hashim and I conceived of the idea that we could visualize these very rare and transient tautomers," Isaac Kimsey, another of the team's researchers, told the Sundial. Tautomers were one of the two types of atomic rearrangements.
	
	With assistance from a group of biochemists at Ohio State University, the researchers used an imaging technology called nuclear magnetic resonance, which is similar in design and concept to a conventional MRI machine, but optimized for viewing small particles like protons and electrons. This device "lets us essentially 'see' very rare [less than 0.1 percent] movement of atoms on very short time scales," said Kimsey. This data, along with some computational tools developed by Kimsey, can "simulate how this could lead DNA polymerases to make a mistake when copying DNA."
	
	The journal article will be scrutinized by other experts in the field, through replication and additional peer review, but if the results bear out, it might change medical science.
	
	"The obvious [application] is cancer," said Dr. Al-Hashimi. "Cancer is a disease of DNA where you end up with mutations in certain positions. So, understanding how those mutations occur in the first place...we may be in a better position to know the susceptibility of certain individuals to cancers or understand how certain carcinogens lead to more mutations, which then lead to cancer."
	
	But any medical miracles this study might play a part in are no doubt in the distant future, and science is all about slow and steady progress, Jason Reddick, associate professor of biochemistry at UNC-Greensboro, reminds the public.
	
	"I think it was a good study, and it probably helps understand a fundamental question about DNA mutation rates," Reddick told the Sundial via email.
	
	When asked about potential challenges to the study, Reddick continued, "But I wouldn't call it a game changer for molecular biology. An example of a game changer to me is something like the CRISPR/Cas9 technology, and I don't think this study, as nice as it was, approaches the breadth of that."
	
	CRISPR/Cas9 is a gene-editing technology based on a family of bacterial DNA sequences. In combination with other developing nanotechnologies, it may revolutionize healthcare.
	
	Whether cancer treatment or prevention is aided or not from Al-Hashimi and associates' discovery, one more mystery of the human body has been brought to light.
	
	Eric Szymanski, a graduate student working under Dr. Al-Hashimi, who also contributed to the study, pointed out that "the quantum jitters themselves might be involved in other aspects of DNA mutations."
	
	Szymanski continued, "I think this work, and, in general, the work in our lab shows the importance of understanding that life wiggles and jiggles, and that dynamic processes can contribute in unexpected ways."</body>

    <title>Confederate Flag Over Hillsborough? Permit Stokes Discontent</title>
    <subhead>Applicant wants battle flag on 60-foot pole</subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>CHAPEL HILL&#x2014;About a dozen Orange County residents voiced their concerns at a county commissioners' meeting Tuesday night over the recent approval of a flag permit acquired by a right-wing neo-Confederate organization to display the &#x201C;Stars and Bars&#x201D; Confederate battle ensign next to a state highway.
	
	The Orange County Board of Commissioners work session was held at the Southern Human Services Center in Chapel Hill, where residents petitioned board members to place at least some limitations on the size and location of the flag.
	
	Triangle news sources first reported on February 9 that the &#x201C;Southern heritage group&#x201D; Alamance County Taking Back Alamance County (ACTBAC) had an application granted by the county planning and inspections department for the symbol to be flown atop a 60-foot pole just west of the Hillsborough town limits. The group needed the assistance of a sympathetic property owner willing to hoist the flag on private land, which they found in Robert Hall Jr. However, ACTBAC and its founder, Gary Williamson, have not made a final decision on a location; at least two other sites along major roadways are being considered.
	
	The organization, a proponent for the &#x201C;Lost Cause&#x201D; mythology of the Confederate movement that lost its rebellion against the United States in 1865, did not send a representative to the hearing, and no one who stepped up to the lectern spoke in favor of the flag&#x2019;s display.
	
	The Sundial reached out to Williamson through ACTBAC&#x2019;s website, but has received no response as of this publication.
	
	Among the speakers at Tuesday&#x2019;s hearing was Patricia Clayton, the president of the NAACP&#x2019;s Northern Orange branch.
	
	&#x201C;We are a close-knit community in northern Orange County, and we want to continue our unique unity,&#x201D; Clayton told the commissioners.
	
	Chapel Hill resident Joe Cole spoke candidly about his own family&#x2019;s history of benefiting from and enforcing racial hierarchies in the Jim Crow South.
	
	&#x201C;In recent years I have learned that one of my grandfathers was a member of the [Ku Klux] Klan in West Virginia... Learning this was very painful for me,&#x201D; Cole said. He explained to the board that, in his view, the Confederate flag &#x201C;is a symbol of racism and terrorism...and I think that&#x2019;s unacceptable.&#x201D;
	
	More than one speaker attempted to address the problem pragmatically, citing ambiguities in the language of the Unified Development Ordinance, which codifies all signage regulation for the county. The UDO places many limitations on the size and type of signs the county can permit, but section 6.12.5 exempts &#x201C;flags, emblems, or insignia of any national, state, or political subdivision&#x201D; from those limitations.
	
	Hillsborough resident Heather Redding opposed an exemption, arguing that because there is no formally recognized Confederate political entity, &#x201C;the Confederate flag is not technically a flag under this definition...and therefore falls into the category of a sign.&#x201D; If the board and planning supervisors interpret the Confederate symbol as such, it would be noncompliant if flown without a permit.
	
	Sarah Cross bluntly told the commissioners that the flag fills her with &#x201C;fear and dread&#x201D; because of its historical associations. She subsequently spoke to the Sundial about perceptions within the community.
	
	&#x201C;I&#x2019;m not concerned with how others perceive Orange County, I&#x2019;m concerned about the impact of the flag on those who live here,&#x201D; Cross said.
	
	Orange High School student Marilyn Allen was one of the many teenagers and young adults who attended to support those speaking in opposition. The Sundial asked Allen if she thinks the county has a moral right to prevent the flag&#x2019;s display. &#x201C;Absolutely,&#x201D; she responded. &#x201C;Everyone knows the history of the Confederate flag; there was a war, they lost it.&#x201D;
	
	Allen went on to explain that her primary worry is a potential drop in real estate prices. &#x201C;Who wants to be in a city with a whole bunch of Confederate flags going up? It&#x2019;ll be a bad look.&#x201D;
	
	Also in the crowd was Latarndra Strong, founder of the Hate-Free Schools Coalition, which led the successful campaign to remove all Confederate symbols from Orange County public schools. Strong sees a clear imperative for the county to act in this situation from a public safety perspective, as she and other activists have been threatened by white supremacists. &#x201C;If you look at the ACTBAC [website and Facebook page], you&#x2019;ll see personal comments about what they&#x2019;re going to do to us and how they&#x2019;re going to harm us,&#x201D; she told the Sundial. &#x201C;So, it&#x2019;s not just a matter of historical terror. It&#x2019;s a matter of us being terrorized now.&#x201D;
	
	Commission chairman Mark Dorosin broke protocol by addressing the petition before sending it to county staff for input.
	
	&#x201C;We&#x2019;ve already asked the county attorney to look into some of the questions that you all have presented,&#x201D; Dorosin said. &#x201C;I want to assure you all that we are taking this matter very seriously, and we&#x2019;re going to explore all the options that we have, moving forward.&#x201D;</body>

    <title>Anti-hate Marchers Decry UNC Monument</title>
    <subhead>Student Leaders Encouraged Crowd to Tear Down "Silent Sam"</subhead>
    <subheadTwo>Threats to UNC instructor spurred campus demonstration</subheadTwo>
    <body>CHAPEL HILL&#x2014;Lively protests on the University of North Carolina campus brought the past and present together again Wednesday, as a crowd of hundreds chanted in defiance against racism and called for the removal of Silent Sam, the statue of an unknown Confederate soldier that memorializes the school's Civil War dead.
	
	Warnings of white supremacist demonstrators, said to be planning a rally or action against UNC assistant professor Dwayne Dixon, drew hundreds of students and faculty to hold an anti-fascist demonstration on the steps of South Building, the administrative building that includes the office of UNC Chancellor Carol Folt.
	
	Approximately 500 people gathered in reaction to threats against Dixon, who recently won a court battle after being charged for carrying a semi-automatic weapon to an anti-discrimination rally in Durham in August.
	
	Also represented in the crowd, and, later, on the podium, was a member of the group that tore down a Civil War memorial statue in front of a Durham County administrative building at 200 East Main Street on August 14, 2017. That incident led to rumors of white supremacists mobilizing in response to the destruction of the statue, which provoked the antifascist demonstration at which Dixon was arrested in August.
	
	Dixon, an assistant professor in the Department of Asian Studies, has drawn attention from the media and among far-right agitators for his involvement with a group called Redneck Revolt.
	
	The far-left organization was founded in 2016, as an anti-racist, anti-fascist community defense organization. They are a group known for showing up at different events carrying semi-automatic weapons and other guns to protect protestors from violence by far-right demonstrators.
	
	On its website, the group gives examples of other armed resistance movements against white oppression in U.S. history.
	
	"From studying the history of these brave resistance fighters, we discover the strength they found in a diversity of tactics and unity across their differences, especially those who stood the line of defense, such as Robert F. Williams in 1957, who with other African Americans, used firearms to drive off the KKK during an attack on the home of the Monroe NAACP president," states Redneck Revolt's website.
	
	A quote featured on the site by Williams says, "I advocated violent self-defense because I don't really think you can have defense against violent racists and against terrorists unless you are prepared to meet violence with violence, and my policy was always to meet violence with more violence."
	
	At the infamous Charlottesville "Unite the Right" rally for white pride and preserving a monument to Confederate General Robert E. Lee in a local park that occurred on August 12, 2017, Dixon was one of about 20 members of Redneck Revolt, many of whom were armed, who attended for the purpose of providing security for counterprotestors.
	
	Dixon later posted on Facebook that he took a "perverse pleasure" by carrying a specific rifle "to chase off James Fields." Fields is the individual who drove his vehicle through the crowd of protestors and is charged in the death of antifascist protestor Heather D. Heyer. After this statement and several interviews, Dixon started receiving hateful comments on social media. Far-right groups have also published articles accusing Dixon of being responsible for Heyer's death.
	
	Dixon's UNC department also started to receive calls and emails about his activities. His personal information started popping up on neo-Nazi websites like the The Daily Stormer.
	
	In Durham on August 18, 2017, members of the progressive community, including some people wearing the masks associated with the Antifa movement, were drawn to Durham in response to warnings of a white supremacist group planning to march or gather in downtown Durham. The perceived threat, word of which was spread via social media by some city officials, including some members of the Durham City Council, never materialized.
	
	Dixon was arrested at that protest by Durham police officers for having a semi-automatic weapon and at least three 30-round magazines in his possession. He was charged with two misdemeanors, having a weapon at a public assembly and going armed to the terror of the people. He was later found not guilty on both charges.
	
	Although white supremacists were similarly a no-show Wednesday on UNC Campus, the protest continued as individuals spoke out against the rise of white power movements and the intimidating methods of the far right against faculty members on campus.
	
	The announcement of a nationalist rally at UNC on Wednesday was made over email to UNC employees by a group that cannot yet be confirmed to exist as an organization, the so-called Kool Kekistani Kids. The shared initialism with the Ku Klux Klan appears to be purposeful.
	
	Responding to published reports of threats against Dixon, hundreds of protestors convened on UNC's campus Wednesday in a show of defiance to white nationalism, racism and hate.
	
	Dixon spoke at Wednesday's rally. "I am being intimidated for doing my job as a citizen," he shouted to a wave of applause and drum rolls. "Yes, I am targeted and yes, I am afraid. But I am surrounded by courage!
	
	"You may not agree with my tactics... but we can discover new pathways to set us all free! What is Antifa? It is the defiance of fear and intimidation. It is not a single trajectory...fighting the past to go into some unknown future. It is right now. We are all tearing apart the mechanisms of fear today...now."
	
	Calls came from the soapbox calling on the crowd to tear down Silent Sam then and there. Unapproved removal of the Civil War memorial has been insinuated by some of its protestors in past years and earlier this school year when protestors camped under the statue in the wake of Charlottesville violence and the Durham statue's removal.
	
	"Tear down that f*cking monument," a UNC student leading chants shouted into a bullhorn Wednesday.
	
	Students came to the microphone and said hate and racism are not welcome on their campus, while off and on doing chants and call-and-response with the crowd.
	
	Dixon also addressed the crowd and spoke of standing up despite fear and not backing down, saying, "If you speak of truth, do not whisper... The time for action has come."
	
	Raul Jimenez, one of the eight people arrested for the tearing down of the Confederate monument in Durham in August 2017, announced that all charges against them had just been dropped, and said, "That means removing symbols of white supremacy is not a crime!" This also received a thunderous applause.
	
	The crowd then started marching on Silent Sam, shouting in unison, "Back up! Back up! We want reedom! Back up! Back up! We don't want no racist cops!"
	
	Other chants warned the police, "Brace yourself, we will fight!"
	
	As hundreds approached the statue, the number of law enforcement numbers visibly started increasing, and things began to calm down. One man could be seen kneeling in prayer as the crowd approached, but his figure was quickly lost in the crowd.
	
	Banners against white supremacy, hate and President Donald Trump were numerous, and clumps of black Antifa flags dotted the crowd. Redneck Revolt members were present, but they were not visibly armed.
	
	North Carolina law bans carrying weapons on college campuses. A bill introduced to the North Carolina General Assembly in March would make it legal to carry a concealed firearm on state university campuses and community colleges. The North Carolina House of Representatives, where it was introduced, has not voted on the bill.
	
	The Wednesday counterprotests at UNC ended peacefully and without incident, as members of the crowd took turns at the microphone and told personal stories of oppression, intimidation and what the statue of the Confederate soldier meant to them.
	
	Silent Sam has been a campus landmark since its dedication, when Julian Carr, the namesake of Chapel Hill's neighboring town of Carrboro, spoke gleefully of "horse-whip[ping] a Negro wench...100 yards from where we stand."
	
	Student protestors who camped in front of the statue during the first week of the Fall 2017 semester and the #RealSilentSam movements have emphasized its tainted legacy in the context of historical mistreatment of African Americans and minorities in the South.
	
	The statue depicts a soldier in Confederate garb with a rifle but no ammo case, said to be a deliberate omission on the part of the sculptor, Nova Scotia&#x2013;born John Wilson, who completed the work in Boston in 1913, having in that period made numerous Civil War monuments depicting rank-and-file Union and Confederate soldiers. The Daughters of the Confederacy paid $7,500 to commission the statue, which was cast by Gorham Manufacturing Company of Providence, R.I.
	
	The statue was at the center of a tumultuous protest in the first week of the fall semester in 2017, which drew a crowd of approximately 1,000 people calling for the statue's removal. Subsequently, groups of students camped underneath the statue, calling for it removal, until their belongings were cleared away by order of the university several weeks later.</body>

    <title>Journey of Creation: Mountain-to-Sea Trail Meanders Through Orange&#xD;

			ORANGE COUNTY &#x2014; Hopping across a brook from rock to rock, winding through misty trees, fording stream with a walking stick &#x2014; what if you could cross an entire state this way?
	
	For those who worked to conceive and realize the Mountains-to-Sea Trail, which will link North Carolina&#x2019;s coastline and the Great Smoky Mountains, the rewards will be both life-changing journeys and conservation of the state's wonders.&#xD;
		&#xD;
		&lt;span style="font-family: open-sans, serif;"&gt;Howard Lee, Tom Earnhardt and Jim Hallsey hike the Mountains-to-Sea Trail near Mt. Jefferson Overlook on the Blue Ridge Parkway, northeast of Boone. Lee, a former mayor of Chapel Hill, served as secretary of the Department of Natural Resources and Community Development under Gov. Jim Hunt, and proposed that North Carolina build a trail from the mountains to the coast. Photo courtesy of Jerry Barker.&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;
		&#xD;
					The trail&#x2019;s route through Orange County was adopted in January, another step in a project that crosses 1,175 miles and more than 20 counties in its route to the sea. It traverses the state from Clingmans dome in the west to Jockey&#x2019;s Ridge State Park on the Outer Banks.
	
	&#x201C;It was going to begin a couple of weekends ago on the Seven Mile Creek Preserve section, but rain postponed the work,&#x201D; said director Kate Dixon of the organization Friends of the Mountains-to-Sea Trail.
	
	The preserve is 300 acres located below I-85, southwest of Hillsborough. The Orange County Board of Commissioners' approval of the Mountains-to-Sea Trail (MST) map gives the Orange County Department of Environment, Agriculture, Parks &amp;amp; Recreation the go-ahead to blaze forward.
	
	Partners across the state are helping to plan and build the trail, which will link communities and serve as the backbone of a growing system of land and water trails in North Carolina.
	
	Friends of the MST are ready to start marking the trail through Orange County. &#x201C;We are in contact with a number of landowners already,&#x201D; said Livingston.&#xD;

		&#xD;
					Individuals who are not interested in a section of the trail going through their property can simply decline.
	
	&#x201C;It is all on a voluntary basis,&#x201D; Livingston said. &#x201C;If someone does not want their property used, we just move the trail north or south or east or west, depending on that section of the trail.
	
	&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;&#x201C;It is a long process.&#x201D;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
	
	Years of work have brought the 40-year-old Mountains-to-Sea Trail project to the segment at Seven Mile Creek Preserve.
	
	&#x201C;Each county is responsible for their section of the MST for land acquisitions,&#x201D; said Orange County&#x2019;s Land Conservation Manager Kim Livingston. &#x201C;The approval of the proposed route gives us the thumbs-up for land acquisitions and required trail easements.
	
	&#x201C;It&#x2019;s a long process,&#x201D; Livingston said.
	
	In 2000, the NC General Assembly authorized the MST as a unit of the North Carolina Parks System.
	
	According to The NC Division of Parks and Recreation, over 600 miles of dedicated trail &#x2014; more than half the planned length &#x2014; have been completed to date and are open for hiking.
	
	A series of interim roadway connectors, namely bicycle routes and back roads, have been identified by the Friends of the Mountains-to-Sea Trail organization to temporarily knit together the completed sections of the MST across the state.
	
	The organization is a group of volunteers across the state who have put in many years of their time to ensure the completion of the MST.
	
	&#x201C;People can and have hiked across the whole MST now,&#x201D; said Dixon. &#x201C;But they have to use public roads and incomplete routes.&#x201D;
	
	&#x201C;On average, there is 10 to 20 miles completed every year,&#x201D; Dixon said.
	
	&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Bird life and dolphins&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
	
	Jerry Baker, a retired NC State student affairs administrator, is one of several who have completed the entire span, and he has also included many students and church groups as he hiked different sections.
	
	&#x201C;I completed the trail last March. I am a section hiker, so I did not complete the entire trail at once,&#x201D; said Baker. &#x201C;I even counted 2 pieces that were [hiked] 21 and 25 years ago.
	
	&#x201C;I got serious about three years ago and did most of it in two and a half years. It took 75 hiking days to do that, with an average of 13.5 miles a day.&#x201D;
	
	In addition to hiking, the 72-year-old also canoed 145 miles of the Neuse River with a fellow trailblazer from Oregon.
	
	&#x201C;That was one of the most interesting parts of the trail. I hadn't done much paddling before,&#x201D; Baker said of the five-day trip. It was also miserable at times. &#x201C;It rained straight through the first three days.&#x201D;
	
	The two started in Clayton and went all the way to New Bern. Baker is torn between which areas were his favorite.
	
	&#x201C;I really enjoyed the Outer Banks... Ocracoke in particular,&#x201D; Baker said. &#x201C;There was lots of bird life and dolphins, and we did not have to deal with the heat because it was February.&#x201D;
	
	But Baker also loved Hanging Rock, Pilot Mountain and Mount Mitchell.
	
	Some local examples of completed trail in this area include 77 miles along the Eno River and Falls Lake in Durham and Wake Counties, 33 miles along the Neuse River Greenway in Raleigh and Clayton, 15 miles in Alamance County, 1.3 miles along the Riverwalk and 1.5 miles at the Classical American Homes Preservation Trust (passing by Ayr Mount, a Federal-era plantation house) in Orange County. A third bridge was added over the Eno River in Hillsborough in 2016.
	
	The proposed MST route through Orange County begins at the Haw River in the far southwest corner of the county, parallels Cane Creek to the northeast through OWASA&#x2019;s Cane Creek Reservoir lands, then goes further northeast through the Seven Mile Creek Preserve and Occoneechee Mountain State Natural Area. From there, the trail will follow the Eno River along Hillsborough&#x2019;s Riverwalk and through land owned by Classical American Homes Preservation Trust and Eno River State Park into Durham County.
	
	&#x201C;What we have developed thus far is on land owned by Orange County, The Classical American Homes Preservation Trust and Eno River State Park,&#x201D; said Livingston. &#x201C;Some of the other counties&#x2019; sections follow rivers, creeks and lakes all the way through, but we are crossing a watershed from the Neuse to the Cape Fear.&#x201D; Therefore, more privately owned property is involved.
	
	Along the MST in Orange County, hikers will see rolling Piedmont farms, weathered tobacco barns, the Hillsborough historic district, a former textile village, country churches, flowing streams and rivers, hardwood and pine forests, and lake views.
	
	&#x201C;The project is a work in progress,&#x201D; said Livingston, adding that there is not a set date of completion.
	
	When completed, the MST will enable one to hike from the Smoky Mountains to the Outer Banks on one uninterrupted trail. Though several, like Baker, have hiked the distance already, hikers in this generation and following ones will benefit from the officially designated land.
	
	You can volunteer to build trail by contacting the Friends of the Mountains-to-Sea Trail at http:www.mountaintoseatrail.org or http://www.ncmst.org/, or by contacting the Land Conservation Manager with Orange County Department of Environment, Agriculture, Parks &amp;amp; Recreation at 919-245-2510.&#xD;

    <title>OC Chamber of Commerce Certified as Living Wage Employer</title>
    <subhead>Hillsborough/Orange County Chamber of Commerce Joins OCLW</subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>CARRBORO &#x2014; The Hillsborough/Orange County Chamber of Commerce is now certified by Orange County Living Wage (OCLW) as a living wage employer and a leading public partner in the county-wide effort to raise wages and share prosperity.
	
	The goal of a living wage is to provide the wage earner a minimum hourly wage that would allow a worker to afford a one-bedroom apartment within a reasonable proximity of Orange County.
	
	To calculate this, OCLW measures from the four closest counties and Orange County, double-weighed, to come up with the average rent for a one-bedroom apartment. Then they determine the living wage based on rent being a third of your pay.
	
	For Orange County that comes out to be &lt;a href="https://piedmontsundial.com/calendar/calendar_main_article.php?theArticle=33" target="_blank"&gt;$13.70 an hour,&lt;/a&gt; which is much higher than the than the federal minimum wage, which has been $7.25 an hour since 2009.
	
	All staff with the Chamber of Commerce will now receive this $13.70/hour wage.
	
	The precedent of being the first chamber of commerce to adopt a living wage in North Carolina speaks volumes to the community at large. It is a statement that says Orange County residents deserve a living wage.
	
	 
	
	The oldest town in the Triangle, Hillsborough was founded in 1754 as the seat of local government for Orange County. Along with its rich colonial history, Hillsborough is also known for impressive locally owned shops, restaurants, art galleries, music and literary credentials.
	
	 The chamber, located at 121 North Churton Street in Hillsborough, is a diverse coalition, representing 291 businesses and nonprofits across the county.
	
	In addition to the chamber itself, multiple members have chosen to become certified living wage companies.
	
	 
	
	&#x201C;This means a lot because we consider the chamber to be the leading voice in the county on business development and economic growth,&#x201D; said OCLW Chief Executive Officer Kim Tesoro.
	
	 
	
	On their website, the chamber posts its mission statement as, &#x201C;The Hillsborough/Orange County Chamber of Commerce is the primary voice for member-business development and economic growth through innovative community collaboration.&#x201D;
	
	 
	
	 &#x201C;Increasing wages to meet the living wage standard certainly benefits employees, but [just] as important is the fact that by taking this step and working with OCLW, we are raising awareness of this initiative,&#x201D; Tesoro said.
	
	 
	
	&#x201C;I encourage business owners to research the data on how other communities have benefited with this program.&#x201D;
	
	 
	
	According to OCLW, &#x201C;As of February 2018, 142 employers in Orange County have been certified as living wage employers and raised wages more than $643,000. These employers have given a powerful boost to employees in our community and to our local economy.&#x201D;
	
	 
	
	OCLW Steering Committee Chair Susan Romaine said, &#x201C;I would not be surprised if Hillsborough/Orange County were the only chamber in the entire country that is certified as a living wage employer. It reflects the degree to which our business community views itself as not simply employers, but also as catalysts for creating a more just and sustainable local economy.&#x201D;
	
	 
	
	It was difficult to verify that the Hillsborough/Orange County Chamber is the first in the nation to adopt a living wage. What is certain is that it is the first chamber of commerce in North Carolina to do so.
	
	 
	
	&#x201C;There are currently three living wage programs in North Carolina,&#x201D; said Romaine.  &#x201C;One here, one in Durham and one in Asheville. And the other two do not have a chamber of commerce as a member.&#x201D;
	
	 	
	
	 
	
	For full disclosure, The Piedmont Sundial is a member of OCLW. Orange County Living Wage is a local nonprofit that certifies businesses that voluntarily pay all full-time and part-time employees a living wage. OCLW&#x2019;s roster of living-wage-certified employers includes for-profit and nonprofit employers in Orange County, along with public employers and municipalities. &lt;a href="https://piedmontsundial.com/calendar/calendar_main_article.php?theArticle=33" target="_blank"&gt;The Sundial has previously discussed the OCLW&#x2019;s efforts.&lt;/a&gt; For more information go to www.orangecountylivingwage.org.</body>

    <title>Fed Bureau Eyes Atlantic Drilling, Holds Comment in Raleigh</title>
    <subhead></subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>RALEIGH &#x2014; It was a busy afternoon at the Raleigh Hilton this Monday, February 26, where the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) sought comments from the public on a tendentious offshore Atlantic drilling program.
	
	The scene buzzed with energy as dozens of staff scientists and researchers from the agency, which falls under the federal Department of the Interior, gathered in one large conference room fielding questions and distributing information in what was termed an open-house-style hearing. Folding tables formed a perimeter, and behind each at least two people sat, nameplates visible and flyers and laptops on hand. Each table addressed a different topic of concern regarding offshore drilling.
	
	According to BOEM&#x2019;s estimates, there are approximately 77 to 104 billion barrels of oil, as well as 283 to 378 trillion cubic feet of natural gas able to be extracted from beneath the waters of the outer continental shelf (OCS). The OCS is that part of the continental shelf lying seaward and outside the states&#x2019; jurisdiction, therefore controlled by the federal government. This typically begins three to nine nautical miles from the state's coastal boundary.
	
	There are currently no active oil or natural gas projects off the Atlantic coast, and the last leasing contract for a well anywhere on the eastern seaboard was terminated in 1983. Of the 51 wells drilled off the continental shelf, none affected the waters of North Carolina.
	
	There was, however, an aborted attempt to drill an exploratory well about 40 miles east of the Outer Banks. Mobil, leading a consortium of seven other oil companies, leased the area in 1989 with drilling set to begin in 1990. This plan was halted when activists and concerned citizens managed to harness the negative publicity of the Exxon-Valdez spill and turn public sympathy away from project. The findings of a state-funded scientific report on potential dangers then convinced Governor Jim Martin seek an injunction, which was upheld on appeal.
	
	The Trump administration&#x2019;s plan for drilling in the Atlantic is part of a larger program which would expand extraction in the Pacific and Gulf of Mexico as well. This would add to the growing profits of oil and gas companies, which have also benefited recently from the Obama administration&#x2019;s lifting of an oil export ban in 2015.
	
	Oil and gas exploration can profoundly impact the surrounding environment and economy, with the gravest threat being accidental oil spills. Downstream consequences include feeding U.S. dependence on fossil fuels that are shown to contribute to the degradation of air quality when converted to energy.
	
	Marine life is particularly vulnerable as their ecosystems are very sensitive to change. Even human-generated noise has a negative effect, disturbing echolocation and even inducing hearing loss in dolphins and whales.
	
	Mny at the hearing attended specifically to protest the long-term strategy of fossil fuel extraction.
	
	Meredith Bain of the Climate Reality Project Campus Corps at NC State put it plainly: &#x201C;Offshore drilling is a bad idea. It&#x2019;s not a good way to get energy, because it&#x2019;s carbon-intensive.&#x201D;
	
	Bain believes that government resources might be better spent investing in more sustainable, cleaner energy sources. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s sort of foolish to develop all this high cost, high risk infrastructure when we could be focusing on wind and solar&#x2026; We have this very rich offshore wind resource that&#x2019;s being neglected at the expense of fossil fuels, and the reason that&#x2019;s happening is because of vested corporate interests,&#x201D; she said.
	
	Environmental organizations large and small passed out leaflets and offered counterproposals in the hotel lobby.
	
	Drew Hudson, spokesperson for the North Carolina Alliance To Protect Our People and The Places We Live (NC APPPL) had harsh words for what he claimed was a fake show of participatory democracy.
	
	&#x201C;The process is a sham, and we know that it&#x2019;s a sham. [There was] a huge series of hearings put on by the Obama administration&#x2019;s BOEM... The decision that came out of that was that they said, &#x2018;No offshore drilling anywhere on the eastern seaboard.&#x2019;&#x201D;
	
	&#x201C;The Trump administration, because they want to open ninety percent of coastline to gas and oil drilling, has decided that none of that comment counts,&#x201D; Hudson continued.
	
	By contrast, many of the BOEM scientists in the room felt that the hearing was quite valuable, and made the point that they are often career public servants some of whom are as concerned with ecological harmony as any other citizen.
	
	Bill Vocke, a senior advisor in the Oil Spill Preparedness Division (a branch of the U.S. Department of the Interior&#x2019;s Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement), told the Sundial, &#x201C;I&#x2019;ve been involved in things like this throughout my career, and the people that are putting this on are of high integrity.&#x201D;
	
	Vocke went on to say, &#x201C;The hard part is trying to explain it in terms that people who don&#x2019;t have a strong scientific background can understand.&#x201D;
	
	This was a point that was driven home by the reams of colorful printouts detailing each moving part of the program.
	
	Experts in fields like marine biology, resource exploration, archaeology, ornithology, risk management, and the economics of tourism were represented.
	
	It wasn&#x2019;t just the topic of the meeting that some attendees impuned; it was also the format. The open-house style of public hearing is an unusual alternative to an open-mic, town hall style meeting in which concerned members of the public make comments and ask questions one by one in front of an audience.
	
	When asked about this approach, Connie Gillette, BOEM&#x2019;s Chief of Public Affairs, said that the organization was using the open house format to facilitate authentic conversation between a government and its constituents.
	
	&#x201C;We started doing it in this format because we found that our purpose in being here is to actually get comments that can help the secretary [of the interior] make a decision,&#x201D; Gillette said. &#x201C;Having a town hall doesn&#x2019;t really help us do our jobs.&#x201D;
	
	Meredith Bain suggested there was a different reason for this format.
	
	In a town-hall style of hearing, &#x201C;each person would get to go up and say what they think about the proposed plan individually, which gives [BOEM] a general sense of who&#x2019;s for and who&#x2019;s against it, so they have much fuller picture of public opinion,&#x201D; Meredith Bain told the Sundial.
	
	She went on to say, &#x201C;In the open-house format it&#x2019;s not really set-up for people to give their opinion, it&#x2019;s more like [BOEM] is just giving you their talking points and then sending you off for &#x2018;public comment.&#x2019;&#x201D;
	
	Voices of dissent might indeed have greater control of the conversation at a town hall;
	
	however, a room of 30 technical experts and numerous administrators available for one-on-one dialogue with an unstructured four-hour time block offered the public a a buffet of information in a topic brimming with complexity.
	
	Participants moved to a booth where they were given the opportunity to fill out a comment form by hand. (This form is also available to anyone on BOEM&#x2019;s website).
	
	When this round of comments is processed, as well as those submitted in the other east coast cities where hearings are held, BOEM will redraft the proposal. There will be an additional 90-day comment period before the final version of the program is sent to Congress and, if that is successful, to the president for approval. If passed, this final form of the program would be implemented in January of 2019.</body>

    <title>Two Years After CDC Opioid Guidelines Change, NC Still Sees Long Battle Ahead</title>
    <subhead></subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>CHAPEL HILL &#x2014; During a federal push to curtail opioid abuse among Americans, physicians have changed the way they recommend and prescribe opium-derived or synthesized painkillers for patients who use them.
	
	In early March of 2016, in response to public and institutional pressure to address the climbing rate of overdose deaths across the United States, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/prescribing/clinical-tools.html" target="_blank"&gt;a set of 12 guidelines&lt;/a&gt; for primary care providers who regularly prescribe narcotics for chronic pain that is not for active cancer treatment, palliative care or end-of-life care.
	
	Two years later, the Piedmont Sundial has spoken with management professionals, law enforcement officials, harm reduction experts and a person who sells prescription pills illegally, in order to assess what the impact new guidelines may have had in the Piedmont and the Triangle in particular.
	
	&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;The &#x201C;Fix&#x201D; Problem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
	
	Opioids are any compounds that have been synthesized or isolated from certain alkaloids found in the opium poppy flower. These include codeine, morphine, heroin, oxycodone and hydrocodone. 
	
	Their use for pain control has been shown to cause addiction and recreational abuse. Addiction can be influenced by genetic and psychological factors as well.
	
	The national opioid epidemic is currently claiming more lives daily than either automobile accidents or gunshots, and North Carolina is no exception. On March 6 of this year the CDC published a study revealing that emergency room visits involving opioids increased 67 percent in the Midwest and 14 percent in the Southeast between 2016 and 2017.
	
	Between 2005 and 2015, North Carolina has seen a 73 percent increase in deaths related to opioid consumption. For example, in 2005 there were 35 deaths in Wake County in which heroin or painkillers were a major contributing factor; by 2015 the number of fatalities had jumped to 62. In Durham County the numbers were six and 17 respectively. 
	
	According to data collected by the N.C. State Center for Health Statistics, North Carolinians have suffered unintentional opioid-related deaths at a rate that has increased by a factor of more than three in one 15-year span. Those numbers were approximately 100 deaths per quarter in 2001 and 2002, but exceeded 200 deaths per quarter a decade later. The most recent data collected, in the fourth quarter of 2016, shows the number of deaths shot up to nearly 300. (The center's statistics include North Carolina residents who died out of the state.)
	
	&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Do No Harm &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
	
	Doctors are now asked to prescribe opioids only after every other avenue is exhausted, and to weigh the risks and benefits on a case-by-case basis. Patients in acute pain after an injury or medical procedure are not supposed to be given more than one week&#x2019;s worth of narcotic medication; and dosage recommendations for all patients have lowered from previous figures, with the exception of those provided to patients in hospice care.
	
	Doctors who specialize in diagnosing and treating chronic pain are in a tough position. They do not want to contribute to the health crisis, but they are still tasked with reducing their patients&#x2019; suffering. For some of those patients, opioids have been the only relief they&#x2019;ve ever known, and restrictions could take that away.
	
	The guidelines the CDC published are only recommendations, but doctors who choose to deviate from them will be all the more vulnerable to malpractice lawsuits and license revocation, should a patient develop an addiction or accidentally overdose. As a result, many physicians have been treating the suggestions as if they are the letter of the law.
	
	Dr. Brooke Alison Chidgey, a professor at UNC-Chapel Hill&#x2019;s Department of Anesthesiology in the School of Medicine, explains over email how we got to this point. &#x201C;Twenty years ago we were essentially told denying patients this treatment option was causing them undue harm.&#x201D;
	
	Through the 1980s and &#x2019;90s, the pharmaceutical industry, in tandem with chronic pain patient advocacy organizations, led a successful pro-opioid marketing campaign backed by what many doctors now consider to be dubious science. Patients suffering from maladies such as chronic neuropathic and musculoskeletal pain felt as if they were being taken seriously by the medical establishment for the first time. Many people previously debilitated by pain could approach a life of normalcy.
	
	This newfound compassion for pain sufferers on the part of the public and the medical establishment led to two widespread misconceptions. The first was that doctors could practice titration to effect, which means to increase the dose gradually until the patient says it&#x2019;s working, with no dosage ceiling.
	
	The second misconception was that the risk of addiction was low; only around 1 percent of those receiving opioids for pain were expected to become physically and psychologically dependent. This belief was often cited on the basis of a 1980 letter &#x2014; not a study &#x2014; published in the New England Journal of Medicine that is now infamous for being used far and wide as vindication for liberal opioid prescription. (Business Insider has published &lt;a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/porter-and-jick-letter-launched-the-opioid-epidemic-2016-5" target="_blank"&gt;a review&lt;/a&gt; of the effects of this letter.)
	
	Actual incidence of addiction after prescribed use is much higher than 1 percent, wrote Chidgey. &#x201C;There is quite [a lot of] variability in the literature&#x2026; A lot depends on definitions used. Studying pain patients is very difficult because there are many confounding variables.&#x201D;
	
	She added another example of medical misguidance. &#x201C;In 2001, the Joint Commission and National Pharmaceutical Council put forth a guide on opioids that essentially says that we are overestimating the risk of addiction and our patients deserve better care &#x2014; give them opioids,&#x201D; Chidgey said. She added, &#x201C;turns out that Purdue &#x2014; the maker of OxyContin [a patented, time-released oxycodone formulation] &#x2014; sponsored the guide.&#x201D;
	
	One way in which clinicians try to help reduce overall opioid use is by giving preference to alternative treatments and making use of narcotic medication only for those who do not respond to things like biofeedback and exercise.
	
	But Chidgey told the Sundial that the insurance industry does not make this option easy. &#x201C;Medicaid, for example, only covers one to three visits [of physical therapy] per year... The usual part-time treatment plan would include three visits per week for 6 to 12 weeks,&#x201D; she wrote.
	
	On top of that, &#x201C;the insurance companies often require us to fill out extra paperwork to justify why we are choosing these options.&#x201D;
	
	&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Policing the Problem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
	
	Doctors aren&#x2019;t the only ones facing hurdles in the war against opioids.
	
	Sergeant David Deshaies of the Pittsboro Police Department spoke to the Sundial via email and said, &#x201C;Overdose calls have continued unabated.&#x201D;
	
	Deshaies added, &#x201C;At the current time, both [pills and heroin] are so easy to find that it's unlikely to drop by any noticeable quantity.&#x201D;
	
	There is more that can be done, Deshaies says, at the local and county level to reduce the related social problems that come with high rates of drug addiction.
	
	&#x201C;The easiest thing to do to help with the epidemic would be to enforce stronger nuisance abatement policies and procedures,&#x201D; he said.
	
	Deshaies was referring to a belief among law enforcement agencies and city managers across the nation that using strict building and safety code enforcement can dramatically increase the quality of life in a community. This belief has been growing in popularity across the nation, with major initiatives occurring in cities like Seattle and Albuquerque.
	
	&#x201C;If you are unable to keep illicit drugs and violence off your property, the local jurisdiction's ability to remove you from the area to improve everyone's quality of life would help,&#x201D; Deshaies said.
	
	&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Notes From the Underground&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
	
	Illicit businesses are hard to study, and usually the only individuals who can keep track of trends are active participants.
	
	The Sundial spoke with one person in his early twenties who sold diverted prescription opioids and illicitly manufactured pills acquired on the &#x201C;dark web&#x201D; (an anonymously browsed portion of the internet) to fellow students at a university in the Triangle. The person wished to remain nameless due to the prospect of legal reprisals for illegally selling FDA-scheduled drugs.
	
	The seller said that once the physicians guidelines changed, it eventually &#x201C;became pretty hard to get prescription painkillers... It got to the point where a single 40 milligram Opana [brand-name oxycodone] pill would cost you like $100.&#x201D;
	
	But this hasn&#x2019;t kept anyone seeking an opioid fix from getting one. &#x201C;Around here people just started selling heroin instead,&#x201D; the seller said.
	
	The seller said they understand the ethical position in which they have placed their self, and made it a point to say that &#x201C;between the end of last year and the beginning of this year, I have seen four people I know die from this.&#x201D;
	
	The seller added, &#x201C;At first it seems really benign when you give someone a pill and they leave your house and you don&#x2019;t know what happens to them, but when it&#x2019;s your friends and you see them get hurt, you carry around a lot of guilt about it.&#x201D;
	
	&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;A Holistic Approach&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
	
	There is one organization that sees light at the end of the tunnel. Project Lazarus is a harm reduction and public health group that was created in 2007 in Wilkes County, North Carolina, in response to shockingly high overdose mortality rates in the area.
	
	According to its mission statement, the model Project Lazarus advocates is &#x201C;based on the twin premises that overdose deaths are preventable and that all communities are responsible for their own health.&#x201D; They have a multipronged approach, providing naloxone rescue kits for overdoses (naloxone is a drug that reverses an opioid overdose by blocking corresponding neural receptors), education and recovery programs, and Medicaid enrollment, as well as advocating for specialized training for law enforcement and drop-off boxes for unwanted or expired pills to keep them off the streets.
	
	Project Lazarus pesident and CEO Fred Branson II sees North Carolina leading the way in combatting opioid abuse nationwide.
	
	&#x201C;For a number of years now, North Carolina has been more at the forefront of addressing the opioid/substance use issue than other states,&#x201D; Branson said via email. &#x201C;North Carolina statewide workgroups are consistently active and collaborating, addressing all aspects, from the harm reduction components, to prescriber education, to increase in addiction treatment. Over time, these are effective.&#x201D;
	
	But Branson made it clear that there is much more work to be done, saying that it will be necessary to &#x201C;enact availability for various modalities of addiction treatment.&#x201D; 
	
	The two dominant treatment options in the United States are abstinence-based rehab clinics and opioid substitution sites. The latter dispenses Methadone and Suboxone, synthetic opioids designed specifically for those in recovery. 
	
	Methadone clinics offer a single dose per day at a single location. This method is meant to reduce the antisocial behavior that comes along with a life of active addiction, such as violence and fraud.
	
	&#x201C;What other treatment of a disease requires [that] we herd people into a clinic daily in order for them to obtain treatment?&#x201D; he asked. &#x201C;It is actually easier to obtain the substances of use than the means for the necessary treatment.&#x201D;
	
	&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Moving Forward&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
	
	As for the physician guidelines themselves, Branson thinks they &#x201C;were meant to be just that, guidelines, not the end-all, be-all. In no way can pain treatment be of the &#x2018;cookie cutter&#x2019; mold and with many [primary care physicians] adopting the guidelines as protocol, we do find the components of the guidelines not all scientifically based or...accessible.&#x201D;
	
	For its part, the state government introduced the Opioid Action Plan in 2016, which lays out a strategy for 2017 through 2021 attempting to coordinate efforts in all the domains discussed above on a statewide level. (A copy can be located on the N.C. Department of Health and Human Services website.) This depends on health care professionals, local government officials, police and concerned community members working hand in hand.</body>

    <title>Carrboro-Based Folk Artist Talks Inspiration</title>
    <subhead>"Words Get Inside of Your Soul."</subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>&#xD;

		&#xD;
			CARRBORO&#x2014;Imagine sitting in your regular dive bar and during idle conversation it becomes apparent that to your right is an artist with the soulfulness of Jim Croce and the voice of Joan Baez.
	
	That&#x2019;s Caitlin Washburn, a rising folk artist based in Carrboro. If you have heard her, you might agree that words don&#x2019;t do her or her music justice.&#xD;
		&#xD;

		&#xD;
					In fact, it&#x2019;s that sentiment that drew her to music in the first place.
	
	&#x201C;I started out a writer &#x2014; poetry, mostly,&#x201D; said Washburn, 28. She learned the piano as a child, but didn&#x2019;t see music as a necessary creative outlet until she had experiences that words alone could not express.
	
	&#x201C;It was the poetry&#x2026; Words get inside of your soul and inside of your blood, and you need to get it out. There&#x2019;s so much character to it; music is so real and full of personality. It comes out in a way that it doesn&#x2019;t when you&#x2019;re just writing.&#x201D;
	
	Washburn&#x2019;s personal journey gained momentum when, at the age of 20 and inspired by Bob Dylan, she grabbed her brother&#x2019;s guitar and began to teach herself chord progressions.
	
	From Wichita Falls, Texas, Washburn traveled to Scotland, where she earned her master&#x2019;s degree in Theology, Imagination, and the Arts from the University of St Andrews, and pursued a doctorate. While there, she experienced a crisis of faith.
	
	&#x201C;I left the relatively safe confines of academic theology and let myself fully be a poet&#x2026; You find yourself still praying to someone or something that you don&#x2019;t really understand, and you realize that you don&#x2019;t need to. You sing about it instead of understanding it.&#x201D;
	
	In May 2014, while soul-searching, she played her first show in Scotland, at a bar called The Criterion.
	
	&#x201C;I played &#x2018;The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down,&#x201D; she said, a song originally recorded by The Band, and the crowd loved it. Not long afterward, she dropped out of school and spent the next six months in isolation.
	
	&#x201C;It was a lot of time alone in my own head, getting to know my own issues, and there was nothing for me to do but confront them.&#x201D;
	
	She moved to Raleigh in 2015 and worked by day as an editorial assistant. She chose North Carolina because her mother&#x2014; the youngest of 10 children &#x2014; was from Buies Creek, about an hour away. It was a way for her to have some familiarity while still finding her own way.
	
	Playing gigs in the Triangle inspired Washburn to quit her office job and invest more in her music.
	
	&#x201C;I was sitting in front of a computer all day,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;It was draining. Now I&#x2019;m on my feet all day doing menial labor.&#x201D; She works at a party store. &#x201C;It gives you a lot more freedom to let your mind wander. It&#x2019;s helped me creatively, doing mindless tasks.&#x201D;
	
	She got a gig playing at 2nd Wind, a bar in Carrboro, and decided to make another change and relocate.
	
	&#x201C;My intuition brought me to Carrboro,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s nice because it&#x2019;s got a small-town feel. It&#x2019;s got a lot of character. You can just walk around and run into somebody you know. I was living in a small town in Scotland, and it reminded me of that. It felt like the right place to be.&#x201D;
	
	In spite of all the uncertainty over the years, Washburn seems to have remained perpetually upbeat. She has had negative experiences that are essential to the music she plays, but she has found creation in them rather than destruction.
	
	If people didn&#x2019;t like her, &#x201C;I guess I would keep [making music] anyway,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;I think I&#x2019;ve developed enough of a sense of myself and my purpose that it&#x2019;s not so much about whether individual people are accepting me.&#x201D;
	
	In that thinking, Washburn doesn&#x2019;t pay any mind to social media or trends.
	
	&#x201C;When I was still in grad school, back home in Texas for the holidays, my mom told me, &#x2018;Be who you are and do what you do.&#x2019;&#x201D; This thinking lends itself to great clarity and focus.
	
	That sureness in herself and the wisdom that comes with it is reflected in her lyrics:
	
	The angels will wrestle and break you
	
	While the demons caress you and take you
	
	This world&#x2019;s not made to be soft
	
	We&#x2019;re all a little bit lost
	
	From &#x201C;Hardest Thing of All&#x201D; on the album &#x201C;Fragile Hands&#x201D;
	
	Washburn writes her lyrics first, without any plan for the accompanying music, which she writes later.
	
	Washburn says she&#x2019;s not content, and probably never will be. But she&#x2019;s fine with that.
	
	&#x201C;I think that part of being an artist and having a creative soul is not being content. It&#x2019;s always questioning everything around you and feeling there is more you could be saying. That&#x2019;s what motivates you to write the next song.&#x201D;
	
	Caitlin Washburn is playing at The Cave on Franklin Street Monday, March 12 at 9 PM. Her new EP, &#x201C;Fragile Hands&#x201D;, is available on Spotify.&#xD;

    <title>In Wake of Parkland Massacre, NC Lawmakers Tackle School Safety</title>
    <subhead></subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>RALEIGH&#x2014;Superintendents, boards of education and now state lawmakers are scrambling to address safety in North Carolina schools after America&#x2019;s most recent school mass-shooting.
	
	Seventeen people died after being gunned down at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, on February 14. The killer used an AR-15 style gun, a high-powered, semiautomatic weapon. The incident has prompted many Parkland survivors to call for legislation regulating gun ownership.
	
	On February 20, North Carolina&#x2019;s House Speaker Tim Moore (R), of Cleveland County&#x2019;s 111th District, announced that 47 of his colleagues would be forming the Select Committee on School Safety to examine data and make recommendations for those looking to craft legislation in the future. The date of the first meeting is set for March 21, but the committee and its goals are already facing public scrutiny.
	
	The composition of the committee will reflect party representation in the North Carolina House chamber, which is to say that one-third of its membership will be Democrats and two-thirds Republicans.
	
	NC Rep. John Torbett (R), of Gaston County&#x2019;s District 108, is the committee&#x2019;s co-chair along with Rep. David Lewis (R) of Harnett County&#x2019;s District 53.
	
	&#x201C;The [committee&#x2019;s purpose] is simple &#x2014; keep our children safe in the school surroundings and property. We&#x2019;re probably going to cover everything from facilities to mental health to guns,&#x201D; Torbett informed the Sundial over phone.
	
	Torbett explained that the first step in the process is research oriented. &#x201C;We want to hear about the data first, so we&#x2019;re going to ask professionals to come in and present what we know up to now; and then get committee ideas.&#x201D;
	
	An example of the sort of information being requested is the recent meta-study compiled by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on gun violence incidents, broken down by state.
	
	An estimated 13.7 out of every 100,000 North Carolina residents died from gunshots in 2016, a rate that hasn&#x2019;t been seen since 1997. For perspective, New York and California&#x2019;s rates are 4.4 and 7.9 per 100,000, respectively; North Carolina gun deaths also exceeded the national rate of 11.8 per 100,000.
	
	Although America&#x2019;s gun control debate keeps a stranglehold on the issue of school safety, other topics the committee is likely to address include providing therapy for troubled pupils and the training of peer mediators to keep petty conflicts from escalating to violence.
	
	&#x201C;It&#x2019;s our intent to go ahead and look at having subcommittees that can better drill into those specific categories,&#x201D; said Torbett.
	
	Two categories of particular interest for Torbett are psychological intervention and infrastructure. &#x201C;I personally feel like we haven&#x2019;t engaged with [mental health treatment] enough,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;The quickest and easiest thing would be to look at facility structures and...more SROs, school resource officers.&#x201D;
	
	N.C. Rep. Pricey Harrison (D), who represents Guilford County&#x2019;s 56th district, is also serving on the committee, and is no stranger to the topic of schools and guns.
	
	&#x201C;I have sponsored comprehensive gun safety legislation that was based on what other states have passed after other mass killings,&#x201D; Harrison told the Sundial. &#x201C;When Connecticut passed its gun control [laws] post&#x2013;Sandy Hook, gun violence there dropped by 40 percent, so those are tangible results.&#x201D;
	
	The statistic she is quoting was published in a 2015 study in the American Journal of Public Health by researchers at Johns Hopkins University and University of California, Berkeley.
	
	Harrison's bills never got the support necessary to pass through both chambers of the General Assembly, but she is now determined to use the resources of the committee in her search for solutions.
	
	&#x201C;I will say our one handicap is that we&#x2019;re just a House committee, and any recommendations that a House committee makes has got to be accepted by the Senate, and we haven&#x2019;t had a lot of luck with that,&#x201D; Harrison said.
	
	Harrison also touched on perhaps the most controversial aspect of the discussion: whether or not to allow teachers and other non-law-enforcement school staff to arm themselves on school property. Florida legislators included just such a provision in a bill passed March 7 that also included raising the minimum age of firearm ownership from 18 to 21 &#x2014; a possible template for compromise.
	
	After the Parkland shooting, the president and other Trump administration officials provoked a public backlash by suggesting that American teachers ought to be trained and armed with firearms in the classroom. Torbett said he thinks the attention this has generated is misleading and far from helpful.
	
	&#x201C;We weren&#x2019;t even thinking about that [arming teachers] until we heard the media push that a couple weeks ago,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;There is no intent by this committee to mandate that teachers carry firearms.&#x201D; He was responding to a February 20 press conference where a journalist asked Speaker Moore if that measure would be considered.
	
	Harrison said she believes that any program or security strategy seeking to arm even a small percentage of teachers would require a level of training too impractical to implement.
	
	Harrison said that North Carolina as a state has moved away from gun control legislation in recent years.
	
	&#x201C;Since the Sandy Hook shooting, our state has gone in the exact opposite direction; they&#x2019;ve expanded concealed carry to bars and restaurants that serve alcohol, and school campuses. It&#x2019;s hard to conceive of a compromise when we need to scale all that back,&#x201D; she said.
	
	A North Carolina law, implemented in 2013, currently allows firearms on school property only when the owner has a concealed-carry permit and they are secured in a private vehicle. Bars and restaurants in the state may ban handguns from their premises by posting a sign.
	
	Political science professor Steven Greene, who teaches at North Carolina State University, is not optimistic about the Select Committee on School Safety&#x2019;s potential efficacy.
	
	Its formation, he claims, is just a sign that &#x201C;we&#x2019;re not going to deal with the gun problem; we&#x2019;re going to deal with the school problem, which is just a symptom of a larger problem relating to guns in America.&#x201D;
	
	He went on to state, &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t think there is a way to seriously and successfully address the problem [of mass shootings] without restricting gun ownership.&#x201D;
	
	Active shooter drills are becoming more common in classrooms across the country, and their potential usefulness in subduing violent incidents in schools will likely be explored by the committee.
	
	Greene expressed reservations about the social and cultural impact that being constantly on high alert has on students and teachers. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m sure there is some basic safety stuff kids need to know, but we don&#x2019;t want first graders running around in fear that a madman is going to come shoot up their class,&#x201D; he said.
	
	An expert on state policy, Greene also wrote "The Politics of Parenthood: Causes and Consequences of the Politicization of the American Family". And with two kids of his own in Triangle public schools, the issue of safety in North Carolina schools has personal dimensions for Greene.
	
	The public will have a better sense of the legislative road map once the committee convenes for its first meeting next week.
	
	&#x201C;We may fail, but if we do fail it&#x2019;s not from want of trying,&#x201D; N.C. Rep. Torbett said. &#x201C;I would be ashamed of myself is something happened, knowing we had an opportunity to fix it.&#x201D;</body>

    <title>Nerd Alert: Oak City Comicon Strikes Raleigh</title>
    <subhead>Event Hosted at Raleigh Convention Center</subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>&#xD;
		&#xD;
			RALEIGH&#x2014;Comic book fans, science-fiction geeks, steampunk enthusiasts and nerds of all stripes in the Triangle will have a busy two days this weekend as Raleigh hosts its eighth annual Oak City Comicon.
	
	Comicon is a fan-driven multimedia extravaganza that functions as part artist meet-and-greet, part academic conference, part costume party and part flea market. Most importantly, it is the convergence of a culture whose interests were once considered fringe.  
	
	But nowadays&#x2014;let&#x2019;s face it&#x2014;the nerds have won. The myriad subcultures that grew from the tiny, cult-like book clubs and fanzines of the 1930s and &#x2019;40s have received unprecedented mainstream attention over the last 15 years. Marvel is now the wellspring of one of the most successful film franchises of the last 70 years, and the rise of the graphic novel has elevated sequential image storytelling to the status of literature. 
	
	Some of the bigger names slated to give presentations and appear on panels include comedian and former Mad TV repertory player Orlando Jones,  Eisner Award-winning cartoonist Art Baltazar, prizefighter and voice actor James &#x201C;Buster&#x201D; Douglas (yes, the same one who knocked out Mike Tyson in 1990). They are joined by Lovecraftian podcaster Cap Blackard, and legendary &#x201C;Superman&#x201D; writer and editor Louise Simonson (co-author of the &#x201C;Death of Superman&#x201D; storyline).  
	
	Artist Alley will host booths where individual creators sign books, and take selfies and interact with fans.   
	
	True nerds will have plenty to keep them occupied. Workshops and panel discussions are as diverse as &#x201C;Finding God in Comics,&#x201D; &#x201C;Queer Comics,&#x201D; &#x201C;How to Paint, Prime, and Seal,&#x201D; and &#x201C;Leather Working 101.&#x201D; Cosplay (costume play) is encouraged and will be the main draw for many attendees, who will not find a socially acceptable occasion for their Princess Mononoke outfit otherwise.
	
	Festivities begin at 10 AM Saturday, March 17 and continue through Sunday afternoon. A two-day pass is priced at $40, with some additional VIP tickets available for select events.  &#xD;

    <title>ACC Teams Struggle To Survive March Madness</title>
    <subhead></subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;UPDATE: This article was filed before the outcome of Texas A&amp;amp;M's upset defeat of North Carolina on Sunday.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
	
	MARCH 18 &#x2014; &#x201C;The key to greatness is uncomfortability,&#x201D; says Kenny &#x201C;The Jet&#x201D; Smith, the former North Carolina Tar Heels point guard who was twice an NBA champion with the Houston Rockets. &#x201C;At some point you have to be uncomfortable.&#x201D;
	
	The mark of a champion is to be able to play outside of your regular game, said Smith, reacting from a TV analyst&#x2019;s chair to the historic toppling Friday of No. 1 Virginia in the NCAA Men&#x2019;s Basketball Tournament.
	
	Virginia&#x2019;s upset loss to the 16th-seeded University of Maryland Baltimore County &#x2014; the first time in tournament history a 16-seed had knocked off a number one &#x2014; occurred, to paraphrase Smith, because Virginia failed to adjust to a new style of play against an unfamiliar and determined NCAA tournament opponent.
	
	Virginia, whose ability to control the pace of the game &#x2014; and to keep that pace slow &#x2014; held powerful opponents to low scores during regular season and conference tournament games, was unable to speed things up once the Cavaliers found themselves trailing in Friday&#x2019;s game, thanks to the unrelenting play of UMBC&#x2019;s Jairus Lyles.
	
	That and &#x2014; because sports outcomes are multi-factored &#x2014; Virginia was missing De&#x2019;Andre Hunter, who left the championship game of the ACC Tournament versus North Carolina with an injury. If he had been healthy enough to play, Hunter would probably have guarded Lyles, who scored 28 to lead UMBC to its win against a Virginia team many bracket-pickers had penciled in as a Final Four team.
	
	&#x201C;The Jet&#x201D; became no stranger to NCAA tournament heartbreak when the second-seeded Tar Heels lost to Indiana in the regional semifinals of the 1984 NCAA tournament. Under Dean Smith, the defending-champion Tar Heels lost to Bobby Knight&#x2019;s Hoosiers, 72-68.
	
	But if, as Smith suspected of the Cavaliers, you are dizzied by the tournament&#x2019;s pace of play &#x2014; or overwhelmed by the unrelenting influx of score updates, the simultaneous development of multiple games at once, the plethora of storylines and new heroes, and the rapidity with at which yesterday&#x2019;s Cinderella victor is sent home ragged after the next round, or the plethora of Wildcats (Arizona, Kentucky, Villanova and Davidson &#x2014; two of which, Arizona and Davidson, played each other in the first round) then fret not, for half of those Wildcats would be eliminated by Sunday, and the contenders would be whittled down to a manageable 16 until play resumes Thursday, March 22.&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;b&gt;ACC Teams Scattered,&#xD;
Cardinals and Irish Left Out&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
	
	There are always surprises on Selection Sunday, when the NCAA tournament seedings are handed out (March 11). Some teams learn that they will stay home empty-handed, as recent-year ACC power players like Louisville and Notre Dame discovered this year.
	
	Louisville and the Fighting Irish were bubble teams, whose skill level was considered to be near the cutoff of teams that get selected, but who did not make the cut.
	
	Notre Dame was the first in the bubble, and would have made it had Davidson had not beaten Rhode Island by one point to win the A-10 Conference championship. Because Davidson earned an automatic bid by winning the A-10 conference championship, the Fighting Irish found themselves in 2018 playing as a likely top seed in the NIT tournament, or first among the also-rans.
	
	Ten Atlantic Coast Conference teams made the tournament of 64, Syracuse winning a play-in game against Arizona State. Duke and the defending 2017 NCAA champion UNC Tar Heels were rewarded with No. 2 seedings.
	
	Some, like Miami, did not escape the first round, the 6th-seeded Hurricanes being upset by University of Loyola-Chicago 64-62. N.C. State fell Thursday in the first round to Seton Hall, 94-83, and Virginia Tech lost to Alabama, 86-83.
	
	Others pressed forward, with Clemson besting New Mexico State to move into Sunday&#x2019;s second round. Florida State beat Mizzou and was set to play No. 1 Xavier.
	
	Clemson would play Auburn on Sunday, and Syracuse would play in a coaching battle of college tournament titans Jim Boeheim and Michigan State&#x2019;s Tom Izzo.
	
	Duke beat Iona and Rhode Island to enter the Sweet 16, and Carolina was locked in combat with Texas A&amp;amp;M at the time of filing.&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Underdogs of North&#xD;
Carolina&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
	
	Perennial favorites like Duke and North Carolina play hard in February to earn a high seeding, while lesser-known teams like UNC-Greensboro were included by merit of their conference-championship wins.
	
	Conference championships ensure tournament seedings, and strong in-conference play by North Carolina teams in conferences of lesser strength handed some North Carolina schools the right to say they earned their places in the Big Dance in 2018.
	
	Davidson was knocked out of the first round by Kentucky, 78-73. The MEAC champion N.C. Central Eagles of Durham had the chance to play into the Round of 64, but lost to Texas Southern.
	
	UNC-Greensboro, which won the Southern Conference championship, gave fourth-seeded Gonzaga a run for its money Thursday, losing a squeaker 68-64.
	
	Meanwhile, big-ticket teams were picked off by underdogs from elsewhere around the country. No. 11 Syracuse dropped No. 6 TCU, and No. 11 Loyola Chicago took out No. 3 Tennessee after dispatching Miami.
	
	UMBC, those steely Retrievers who have already played their way into college basketball history, would have little time to bask in the glaze, for on Sunday they would take on Kansas State.

				The Raleigh Convention Center was a geek&#x2019;s paradise the weekend of March 17 and 18 when the Oak City Comicon opened its gates for the eighth year in a row. Science fiction and fantasy aficionados, medieval armor smiths, action figure collectors, vintage movie poster dealers and prop crafters of all stripes representing cities in and around the Triangle flooded the venue with their passion and enthusiasm for all things nerdy. The Sundial dropped in on the festivities to speak with writers, visual artists and costumed attendees, all basking in the glory of full-fledged fandom. &#xD;
		&#xD;
		Cosplayers of "Homestuck," a long-running, popular webcomic.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
		&#xD;
					For the uninitiated, Comicon is short for Comic Book Convention, a phenomenon that began in the mid-1960s with roots in early 20th-century fan clubs and zines, but which has grown significantly in influence and scope over the past two decades. The San Diego International Comic-Con, which set the template for most subsequent incarnations, is the largest and most well known. Regional conventions these days are organized and operated independently of one another. 
	
	In the early days, the focus was almost exclusively on the buying and trading of rare, highly sought-after issues of gold- and silver-aged  superhero comic books, meaning those published from the 1930s through the 1950s. This traditional practice was only a small slice of the activities on display this Saturday in Raleigh.
	
	More than one conventioneer who spoke to the Sundial bought tickets just to cosplay (costume play), that is, show off their detailed and intricate homemade costumes, usually based on a favorite character from a novel, film or television show. &#xD;
		&#xD;
		An original, homemade steampunk outfit.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
		&#xD;
					Two cosplayers who stood out in the throng of Boba Fetts and Doctors Who were Durham public school teacher Katie Skipper and her mother Kristen Skipper, a retired diplomat. Both were adorned with floor-length Disney-princess-style ball gowns that could have turned heads on a Hollywood red carpet. And as they made their way across the convention hall, wide-eyed grinning children ran to them excitedly, clutching wands and trailing capes, as if they were seeing the real Elsa and Sleeping Beauty, daughter and mother respectively. 
	
	&#x201C;I&#x2019;ve sewn since I was about eight years old, and have done some costumes for theaters, but that was mostly just a hobby,&#x201D; said Kristen. &#x201C;I like challenging myself to sew more difficult things. It&#x2019;s sort of a mental exercise that I&#x2019;ve kept up with over the years.
	
	&#x201C;As a person of age,&#x201D; Kristen went on to say, &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t get to dress up and go out, and it&#x2019;s nice to have a place where I can channel somebody else.&#x201D;     
	
		Those interested in something less politically problematic than the romantic portrayal of cartoon monarchs could make their way to one of at least four prominent vendor booths dedicated solely to the sale of metal and leather goods within the steampunk asthetic. Steampunk, what began as a literary subgenre, is now an influential retro-futuristic art and design movement that combines classic science fiction tropes with the trappings of older times, typically Victorian or Edwardian or Western fashion and technology. Think &#x201C;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen&#x201D; comics, &#x201C;Wild Wild West&#x201D; 1999 film or the &#x201C;Bioshock&#x201D; videogame series. 
	
	Some cultural critics believe the mainstreaming of the steampunk style can be attributed to contemporary anxieties about the social consequences of rapid technological innovation, similar to the concerns of those who witnessed the industrial revolution firsthand. 
	
	McKenzie Palmer, an artisan of brass goggles and leather masks with Steam &amp;amp; Steel Apparel, a company based in Lenoir, North Carolina, was attracted to it from an early age. &#x201C;I just think the concept is so neat,&#x201D; she said, &#x201C;that we can have new and old come together like that.&#x201D;
	
	Palmer also told the Sundial that the sheer diversity of interests on display is why she keeps returning. &#x201C;I think we can all appreciate each other&#x2019;s work even if we don&#x2019;t quite understand it,&#x201D; she said.
	
	The section of the convention hallmarked Artist Alley on the program map was frenetic and congested, with Comicon die-hards waiting for their chance to speak to a favorite writer or illustrator. One of this year&#x2019;s featured guests was Art Baltazar, a comics auteur who, in addition to being on staff at superhero powerhouse DC Comics, has a self-published line of all-ages graphic novels with zany titles like &#x201C;The Fantastic Flexy Frog&#x201D;, and &#x201C;Sleepy Time Crime&#x201D;. He was even bestowed comics&#x2019; highest honor, the Eisner Award, in 2011. 
	
	Baltazar has been doing the convention circuit for as long as he can remember, finding fan interaction to be immensely satisfying.
	
	&#x201C;Normally I&#x2019;m just at home drawing all the time, and I don&#x2019;t know the impact of what I&#x2019;m doing until I come out to public shows like this,&#x201D; he explained.
	
	He welled up with emotion describing how fans will carry stacks of his old work for him to sign. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s cool but can be kind of overwhelming,&#x201D; he said with a huge smile. 
	
	But what is it about comics as an art form that has stayed so appealing for almost a century?
	
	&#x201C;It&#x2019;s often the first entrance point for reading,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;And it&#x2019;s a great way to tell a story because I don&#x2019;t need a crew, I don&#x2019;t need actors, I don&#x2019;t need lighting, I don&#x2019;t need the weather to be nice.&#x201D;&#xD;
		&#xD;
		A cosplay of Optimus Prime from the "Transformers" franchise.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
		&#xD;
					The gift of imagination, Baltazar said, is key. &#x201C;You can create anything in a sketchbook or a drawing or a little paragraph or poem and it could turn out to be a whole comic book!&#x201D;
	
	If you missed the 2018 Oak City Comicon, you needn&#x2019;t fret too much; you won&#x2019;t have to wait a whole 12 months to dust off that stormtrooper helmet. Durham&#x2019;s own Bull City Comicon will be taking place November 9&#x2013;11. Mark your calendars, nerds. &#xD;

    <title>NC House Committee on School Safety Acknowledges Role of Mental Health </title>
    <subhead></subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>RALEIGH &#x2014; The North Carolina House of Representatives called the first meeting of its school safety committee to order at 9 AM on Wednesday, March 21 in Raleigh. It formed in response to the deadly school shooting in Parkland, Florida, and its members are tasked with investigating every facet of student well-being and security, with the goal of providing formal legislative recommendations at the end of the process. 
	
	Experts gave presentations to committee members on Wednesday on school safety. Gun ownership and availability have been dominating conversation in local and national media, and the committee will hear and address those topics.
	
	However, experts presented on other factors. Two such topics included were the problems of inadequate funding for on-site clinical psychologists and the role psychological well-being plays in establishing safe learning environments. 
	
	To add perspective to these issues currently under consideration by our representatives, the Sundial spoke to a professor who trains school mental health counselors, a North Carolina Center for School Safety representative, a clinical psychologist at John Jay College of Criminal Justice and a Florida psychoanalyst with decades of experience in private practice.  &lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;
	
			Correlation of Mental Health and Violence&lt;/span&gt;The questions about mental health and its connection to school violence and mass shootings in this country can be equally as divisive as the gun control debate itself.  President Trump, Florida Governor Rick Scott and U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions all made public comments alluding to possible pathology in the days after the Parkland shooting. This prompted a flood of think pieces agreeing or disagreeing. 
	
	 After all, the label &#x201C;mental illness&#x201D; covers a great many particular issues, and roughly 40 million adults in the United States have suffered suffering from some sort of mental health issue during any given year of the last decade. According to the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), in 2016 that figure worked out to 18.6 percent of Americans 18 and older potentially in need of treatment.
	
	James Deni, a professor in Appalachian State University&#x2019;s psychology department, gave a concise but thorough lecture to the committee on the deficits of the current system and possible improvements.  Deni says that public school psychologists, whom he trains and represents on various professional boards, are being hindered in their assigned task of making schools safer through effective diagnosis and intervention. 
	
	&#x201C;[School psychologists] are the individuals who are responsible for all the assessment on students who have these [mental] disabilities,&#x201D; Deni said over the phone. &#x201C;We&#x2019;re so bogged down with [evaluations and assessments]... And because we&#x2019;re understaffed, we can&#x2019;t get to all the other comprehensive roles we&#x2019;re trained in.&#x201D; 
	
	These roles should include educating the families of troubled adolescents on what part they should be playing in their loved ones&#x2019; treatment, providing some form of limited group counseling for students who would benefit from it, and helping to develop individualized education programs (IEPs) for students whose cases are unique. 
	
	Then, Deni continued, there is the staffing problem. The National Association of School Psychologists advises a ratio of one psychologist for every 500 to 700 students in order to ensure availability of the time and resources required to succeed. In North Carolina the statewide ratio is currently one per 2,100 students.
	
	 &#x201C;We have to build up our staffing ratio, and to do that I think we&#x2019;d have to increase salaries so we could be competitive,&#x201D; Deni suggested as the next logical step. &#x201C;And we would have to get relief on reciprocity [one state accepting another state&#x2019;s medical licenses], so as not to create barriers for those coming from other states,&#x201D; he added. North Carolina is not one of the 31 states that recognize national school psychologist licensing boards. This complicates the recruiting process and disincentivizes the hiring of qualified candidates trained elsewhere, by requiring them to apply for licensure all over again.     
	
		More basic therapeutic services include suicide counseling, emotional intelligence instruction and coaching for balancing school and life. These would be net positives to students&#x2019; emotional welfare. But what about the committee&#x2019;s foundational concern of mass shooter prevention? 
	
	A &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165178105001678" target="_blank"&gt;comprehensive analysis&lt;/a&gt; was compiled by Amy Watson and Patrick Corrigan and making use of the National Comorbidity Survey on the violence rates of mentally ill individuals not undergoing treatment. It reveals a demographic seven percent slightly more prone to physical outbursts resulting in personal injury than the general population. by 7 percent. However, the study concluded that &#x201C;results of the analyses showed that demographic variables, especially gender, are far better predictors of violence than psychiatric diagnosis of either substance abuse or non-substance abuse disorders.&#x201D;  
	
	 Additional research that has focused on severe conditions like psychosis, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder show even more elevated risk levels, with psychosis being the condition most associated with violence. These studies, which represent population samples in the United States, Canada and Western Europe, can be &lt;a href="http://www.treatmentadvocacycenter.org/evidence-and-research/learn-more-about/3633-risk-factors-for-violence-in-serious-mental-illness" target="_blank"&gt;viewed&lt;/a&gt; at the website for the national Treatment Advocacy Center (TAC). 
	
	In a summary of their findings, TAC emphasized five points of interest for those using the findings: that the majority of violent acts are perpetrated by individuals without serious psychiatric conditions, that most mentally ill people are not dangerous, that mentally ill individuals more often suffer without than committing acts of violence, that being young and male or a substance abuser is a greater risk factor than mental illness for committing violence and that individuals with mental illness receiving treatment are not at great risk for committing violence.   
	
	Professor Philip Yanos of the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York City also expressed skepticism of with the premise of the investigation, this line being drawn between mental illness and school danger. He echoed the fourth finding of the Corrigan-Watson study, that being young and male are both statistically greater indicators of violence than any psychiatric taxonomy. This fact has so far not been referred to publicly by the House committee. 
	
	Regarding shootings specifically, other sources see higher correlation. According to research published in Grant Duwe&#x2019;s book, &#x201C;Mass Murder in the United States&#x201D;, and two independent reviews of the available evidence published in the Los Angeles Times and Mother Jones magazine in 2018, between 59 and 61 percent of public mass shootings from 1900 to 2017 were perpetrated by persons who either had already been diagnosed with a severe mental illness or were displaying signs of an undiagnosed condition. For example, Ed Harris, the Columbine High School shooter, was called a &#x201C;psychopath&#x201D; by criminal psychologist Dr. Robert Hare, a term not accepted as a diagnosis in the modern medical community but often associated personality disorders such as narcissism and antisocial personality disorder.
	
	&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;	What&#x2019;s in a Name? The Label of &#x201C;Mentally Ill&#x201D;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
	
	Professor Yanos has extensively studied the interplay between identity and diagnostic terminology, and what impact being given a marginal label like &#x201C;mentally ill&#x201D; can have on the recovery process.
	
	&#x201C;Mental illness occurs at different times in life for people,&#x201D; he related to the Sundial over the phone. &#x201C;So even if the system were able to constantly assess risk among all people who are receiving treatment, it has no information of the risk of people who have yet to develop a disorder or present [themselves] for treatment.
	
	&#x201C;If we&#x2019;re constantly evaluating risk of people who might engage in mental-illness-related violence, that puts a burden on all of society...because mental illness is part of the human condition&#x201D; and therefore extremely common, said Yanos. Using the catch-all of &#x201C;mental illness&#x201D; in discussions regarding safety also creates implicit associations with conditions such as major depression and social anxiety.
	
		  Warren Graditor, a psychoanalytic talk therapist with more than 30 years of successful private practice in Hollywood, Florida (a 20-minute drive east of Parkland), explained that technical classifications &#x201C;are really just meant&#x2026;to be able to communicate in a shorthand manner with other professionals.&#x201D; When jargon enters the broader culture&#x2019;s vocabulary, &#x201C;the lay public picks up on these labels and really doesn&#x2019;t have a sophisticated or deep enough understanding as to what they really mean,&#x201D; he said, adding, &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t think psychopathy and depression are on the same continuum.&#x201D;  
	
	The House committee will convene again in April on an undetermined date. The co-chairs will be expected to have recommendations prepared in anticipation of the General Assembly&#x2019;s mid-May short session.</body>

	(GOVERNMENT) &#x2014; On Wednesday, March 28, the Chapel Hill Town Council approved the use of $12.5 million worth of general obligation (G.O.) bonds to assist in funding public improvement projects. Of this allotment, $4.3 million will be used to purchase the American Legion property on Legion Road and $2.7 million will go toward the construction of an Elliot Road flood storage facility. 
	
	(BUSINESS) &#x2014; Operators of the Kidzu Children&#x2019;s Museum have expressed interest in expanding again after years of success at its current location in University Place (201 S. Estes Dr.) in Chapel Hill. Such growth would necessitate a move, and Southern Village is high on the list of areas under consideration. A petition for the allowance of Chapel Hill&#x2013;owned land for the museum&#x2019;s construction is currently being reviewed by town staff. 
	
	(CRIME) &#x2014; Detectives who had been investigating the March 9 break-in at the Smith Center on the UNC-Chapel Hill campus announced on Friday, March 23, that a person of interest in connection with the crime has been taken into custody in South Carolina.

The resolution, which is titled "In Support of Public Employee Collective Bargaining Rights and Rights for Employee Organizations," was introduced at the council's last work session on March 19. Durham City workers part of UE Local 150 were the first&amp;nbsp; to request the resolution. The vote is scheduled for April 2.
	
	(BUSINESS) &#x2014; The Durham-based nonprofit addiction rehabilitation services program, Triangle Residential Options for Substance Abusers, is hoping to open a new campus in the Triad with the help of state funds. Greensboro and Winston-Salem are both being considered as host cities. This week, Democratic state house Representative MaryAnn Black told the media she believes there are now enough state legislators interested in solving the escalating opioid crisis that government funding may be available as early as 2019. 
	
	(EDUCATION) &#x2014; Three senior Duke University administrators sent a memo out to the faculty on Wednesday, March 21 informing them that the National Institute of Health will now be requiring all researchers to ask for special permission to transfer unspent grant money from one project to another.

A change in the eligibility laws lowering the number of voter signatures required for acceptance by the board was passed in October 2017
	
	(GOVERNMENT) &#x2014; Patrick Register, a long-shot candidate for the North Carolina House Democratic primary, made headlines this past week for choosing to campaign on the social media dating app Tinder, normally reserved for romantic connections. Register must unseat incumbent Rep. Alma Adams to move on to the general election.
	
	&lt;br&gt;

	(GOVERNMENT) &#x2014; A rally in support of stricter gun control legislation was held on the UNC-Chapel Hill campus on Thursday, March 29. Chapel Hill Mayor Pam Hemminger made a speech to the crowd pledging her continued support for the cause, and that of other city officials. Also in attendance was Sarah Chadwick, a survivor of the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, who told those in attendance, &#x201C;Our voices deserve to be heard, and they will be heard.&#x201D;
	
	(BUSINESS) &#x2014; Franklin Street mainstay Spanky&#x2019;s, a restaurant and bar that has sat at the center of UNC&#x2019;s student strip for 40 years, announced this week through the Chapel Hill Restaurant Group that the eatery will be &#x201C;retiring&#x201D; after Saturday, March 31, and to be replaced by a new, yet-to-be-determined business. Spanky&#x2019;s has long been a favorite of UNC athletes and local politicians.
	
	(EMERGENCY) &#x2014; At 6:10 PM on Thursday, March 29, a car driving down Raleigh Road in Chapel Hill burst into flames and had to be extinguished by municipal firefighters.

Curia informed Durham City Manager Tom Bonfield of his retirement plan earlier this week. The process of hiring a new chief is expected to take about four months, although this will be complicated by the planned merger of the Durham city and county fire departments scheduled for July.
	
	(CRIME) &#x2014; Durham police officers arrested a teenager in connection with a March 28 shooting at the Walmart department store on New Hope Commons Drive in which two people were injured.

	(EDUCATION) &#x2014; Superintendent of Durham Public Schools Pascal Mubenga announced this week that Karen Kellett will be replacing Cornelius Redfearn as principal of Glenn Elementary School. The move is meant to prevent a state takeover of the school, as Glenn students consistently underperform academically based on North Carolina&#x2019;s statewide evaluation system. Kellett, who will be leaving her present job as Mangum Elementary School principal to lead the staff at Glenn, has also worked as a development facilitator helping to solve problems at floundering schools.
	
	(ELECTIONS) &#x2013; Satana Deberry, a candidate in the race to be the next Durham County district attorney, has admitted to plagiarizing portions of her website from Philadelphia&#x2019;s district attorney, Larry Krasner. The public was made aware of the cribbed language on the platform section of Deberry&#x2019;s site by Durham lawyer Jonathan Jones, who called the candidate out on his blog.

	&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;State News&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
	
	(HEALTH) &#x2014; The North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services has reported that an additional 11 deaths from the influenza virus in the state last week, which has brought the total death toll for the 2017&#x2013;2018 flu season to 342. Officials say the state is just past the peak for this season, with most fatal cases occurring between February 3 and February 17. Flu season usually ends by the end of March, but has been known to extend into April. 
	
	(RELIGION) &#x2014; United States District Judge Terrence Boyle has ruled in favor of Kwame Teague, an inmate in the North Carolina prison system, who filed a 2015 lawsuit seeking official recognition for his humanist faith. The judicial order requires that the state adjust its administrative software to account for the inclusion of humanism as a new designation. Humanism is a secular belief system built around rationality and humanity&#x2019;s imaginative potential.
	
	&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Greensboro&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
	
	(CRIME) &#x2014; A Greensboro man was convicted on several counts of financial fraud and identity theft in federal court on Thursday, March 29. The evidence presented against Xavier Milton Earquhart implicated him in a variety of unlawful activities, including forging bank liens and deeds, as well as setting up fake holding companies to help transfer stolen property into his name without arousing suspicion. He is facing a possible 30 years in prison.</body>

Sunday&#x2019;s win follows a 4-3 loss to nationally top-ranked Wake Forest on Wednesday, March 28. &lt;br&gt;

	(CRIME) &#x2014; Superior Court Judge Osmond Smith sentenced Thomas Clayton to life in prison without the possibility of parole for his participation in the shooting death of 19-year-old JeJuan Taylor in the parking lot of Duke Manor apartments after a drug deal gone wrong. Three other individuals have also been implicated in Taylor&#x2019;s death, with trials slated for later this year. 
	
	(DEVELOPMENT) &#x2014; It was reported this week that the Charlotte-based firm Lennar Multifamily Communities may be making adjustments to a planned development near the Durham Bulls Athletic Park. As it stands now, the &#x201C;Durham Gateway&#x201D; project would consist of 366 apartments and 660 parking spaces. If the city planning department approves the new changes, close to 100 living spaces would be added to the current blueprints.
	
	(GOVERNMENT) &#x2014; Durham Police Chief C. J. Davis addressed the city council on the evening of Monday, April 2, on the current state of their city&#x2019;s safety. The assessment was mixed, with some negative aspects waning, such as homicides, which dropped by half 2016 and 2017 (42 and 21 deaths respectively). Both rape and robbery rates, however, have seen slight increases during the same period of time. Chief Davis also described a department struggling to demographically reflect the local population, with a police force that is 27 percent African-American protecting a city which is 40 percent black and 38 percent Caucasian.
	
	(SPORTS) &#x2014; The Duke Men&#x2019;s lacrosse team defeated rival UNC on March 30, edging the Tar Heels, 11-10. Duke senior midfielder Sean Cerrone, who had been injured and unable to play in last week&#x2019;s narrow loss to Syracuse, scored the winning goal for the Blue Devils. &lt;br&gt;

    <title>21st Annual Full Frame Documentary Festival Premieres</title>
    <subhead></subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>DURHAM &#x2014; Cinephiles and fans of nonfiction film will converge in Durham this weekend as the world-famous Full Frame Documentary Film Festival kicks off Thursday, offering a bevy of the interesting, exciting, philosophical and unusual. 
	
	Full Frame, which has taken place annually since 1997 (though originally it operated under the moniker Double Take Film Festival), was organized in its first years by Duke University&#x2019;s Center for Documentary Studies. 
	
	In 2002, the festival broke ties with the school and founded its own privately funded nonprofit; it has been breaking its own attendance records every year since.
	
	Full Frame is one of those rare art experiences in which there is something to please all tastes. If you&#x2019;re a policy law school nerd with a soft spot for the regency of the U.S. Supreme Court, perhaps the docu-profile &#x201C;RBG&#x201D;, which takes a sympathetic look at the life of Clinton appointee Ruth Bader Ginsburg and her recent elevation from high court legal interpreter to pop-culture and feminist icon, will be on your list of must-sees.
	
	Looking for something a little more edgy? Maybe a thrill ride with a social conscience, big heart, and a lot of jokes for good measure? 
	
	The short film &#x201C;I Am Bisha&#x201D; has been touring the festival circuit since December, and it has been creating buzz at every stop. Filmed entirely in the Sudan and directed by Roopa Gogineni, this dark comedy presents a young man named Ganja who, after witnessing president Omar al-Bashir drop a bomb near his village, makes the decision to creatively revolt. He and his upstart friends produce their own satirical web series, &#x201C;Bisha TV&#x201D;, savagely mocking their leader, choosing to employ puppets in lieu of live actors. The film follows Ganja as he attempts to write and shoot humorous sketches as the brutal social conditions around him harden.
	
	One of the unique aspects of Full Frame&#x2019;s approach is their commitment to showcasing older but lesser-known documentaries that have slipped through the cracks over the years or weren&#x2019;t fully appreciated upon initial release. The 2018 program has two separately-curated showcase series. The &#x201C;Full Frame Tribute to Jehane Noujaim&#x201D; will be playing five of the acclaimed director&#x2019;s works, including the engrossing and timely 2004 film, &#x201C;Control Room&#x201D;. 
	
	"Control Room", a behind-the-scenes examination of the journalists working at Qatar-based news network Al-Jazeera in 2003 (as George W. Bush&#x2019;s nation-building campaign in Iraq was heating up) still provides an often-missing perspective in Western media coverage of Middle Eastern conflict. 
	
	Noujaim&#x2019;s films &#x201C;The Square,&#x201D; a first-hand account of Egypt&#x2019;s 2011 popular uprising, and &#x201C;Rafea: Solar Mama", which follows a young woman from India learning to build solar energy cells,  are also scheduled.
	
	Guest curator Joe Berlinger, the filmmaker behind the trilogy of HBO-produced &#x201C;Paradise Lost&#x201D; documentaries that chronicled the trial, incarceration, and eventual release of the accused murderers known as the West Memphis Three, has made his own selection of eight quality true-crime stories he thinks every movie buff should watch at least once: Errol Morris&#x2019; exoneration tale, &#x201C;Thin Blue Line&#x201D;, a game-changer if there ever was one, and the 1967 cult favorite &#x201C;Titicut Follies&#x201D;, Frederick Wiseman&#x2019;s stark look at the criminally insane, set the tone for the other six--each one as potent, significant and disturbing as the last.
	
	For those interested in conversations of craft, a number of panel discussions and audience Q&amp;As are scheduled throughout all three days. Topics and panels will include &#x201C;Documentary in the Time of Fake News&#x201D;, a discussion on our era of alternative facts; &#x201C;#DocsSoWhite: The Gatekeepers&#x201D;, which will unpack the racial politics of the documentary festival circuit; and &#x201C;Running With Scissors&#x201D;, an appreciation of the film editor&#x2019;s role in fulfilling a director&#x2019;s artistic vision.
	
	The entire lineup and schedule for Full Frame 2018 is available on the organization&#x2019;s website.
	
	Weekend and day passes had all been sold out as of Wednesday, April 4, so anyone looking to catch a film or two has three options: a $16 general admission ticket, a $14 student, military or senior admission ticket, or a $15 &#x201C;last-minute line&#x201D; ticket that can only be purchased with cash. 
	
	General admission tickets will be available at the Full Frame box office at the Durham Convention Center on West Morgan Street. 
	
	Showings will be spread out over six different Durham venues, with Carolina Theater serving as the flagship location.  
	
	Ticket holders must arrive at their venue 30 minutes prior to start of the film to be guaranteed a seat. More attendees than ever are expected this year.  </body>

    <title>Yesterdays or Doomsday? Gathering Teaches Living In Nature</title>
    <subhead></subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>PITTSBORO&#x2014;A rolling little converted farm compound in Chatham County, the Shakori Hills Community Arts Center hosted The Piedmont Earthskills Gathering last weekend, an event dedicated to keeping alive primitive and preindustrial survival skills that were once widespread among most human cultures, but have long since left the realm of common knowledge. 
	
	The gathering, in its seventh year, attracted gardeners, whittlers, camping enthusiasts, birdwatchers and botanists from across the southeast. In between the main activities, attendees ate communal meals, sang campfire songs and enjoyed the spring weather.  According to organizers, this year&#x2019;s event drew more than 150 participants.
	
	The grounds, near Silk Hope, are best known for showcasing bluegrass and folk music at the annual Shakori Hills Grassroots Festival, 
	
	Classes included &#x201C;Beginning Wet Felting&#x201D;, in which participants were taught a technique to turn loose wool into a seamless fabric satchel, and &#x201C;Spoon Carving&#x201D;, in which participants learned the basics of woodworking by hand. 
	
	The class listed as &#x201C;Hide Tanning&#x201D; required those who signed-up to pay $50 in addition to the admission fee, but in exchange, instructor Matt Hansen took each student through an intensive multi-day workshop transforming a deer hide into a wearable buckskin. 
	
	Doug Elliot, a writer, herbalist, musician and raconteur, returned as a favorite instructor with the class titled &#x201C;Weeds and Wild Woodslore&#x201D;.
	
	&#x201C;I came out of the womb as a nature nut,&#x201D; Elliott told the Sundial, &#x201C;which was great, because I grew up near an estuary off the Chesapeake Bay.&#x201D;
	
	Though interested in earth sciences and biology from an early age, Elliott began his career as an artist and field illustrator. As he travelled, he amassed an encyclopedic knowledge of plant nutrition and folk medicine. 
	
	His love of the natural world shone as he guided a dozen pupils through the surrounding woods, identifying all manner of trees, flowers and weeds. When a particular species he knew to be edible appeared, Elliott encouraged the crowd to take a bite. And all of this was punctuated with Elliott&#x2019;s impressive harmonica riffs and humorous alternative renditions of popular songs, usually changing lyrics a la Weird Al Yankovich to include plant or insect names. 
	
	Elliot explained that his favorite part of coming to teach is all the shop talk he gets to have with those as excited about botanicals and folklore as he is. 
	
	&#x201C;A lot of times, I&#x2019;ll take various groups on walks in the woods, or I&#x2019;ll give these talks, and people will think they are interesting,&#x201D; Elliot said. &#x201C;But when I come to these gatherings, people here actually think it&#x2019;s important, and that makes all the difference.&#x201D;	
	
	One attendee who took part in Elliott&#x2019;s class was Justin Jacobs, a mushroom cultivator and amateur mycologist from Carrboro. Jacobs has attended four of the previous gatherings, and says he sees it growing a little bit each year.
	
	&#x201C;For me, it is definitely therapeutic,&#x201D; Jacobs said, &#x201C;mostly in the sense that I believe that doing things with your own hands and learning these skills are just good to know as a person.&#x201D; 
	
	Jacobs emphasized that he believes it is to society&#x2019;s detriment that we have lost much of this ancient expertise. &#x201C;We&#x2019;re really alienated from what it means to live in the world,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;Our food, our housing...all of these things are now delegated by someone else.&#x201D; 
	
	Edifying oneself by learning skills like fire-building or knife-work, Jacobs says, &#x201C;reminds us what it means to be human and reconnects us with our basic means of survival.&#x201D;
	
	Jacobs continued, noting that spending time among other interested people was one of the best parts of the gathering. &#x201C;It can be difficult in this world to actually find people who not only think [these practices are] good, but cherish learning lost knowledge,&#x201D; he said.
	
		Keith Orlando, a professional home inspector who lives not far from the Shakori grounds, had something similar to say. &#x201C;You have to understand, there&#x2019;s not many of us who are interested in these primitive skills. We&#x2019;re marginalized, and have been made fun of a bit, so when you can meet other people like yourself, it&#x2019;s a great thing.&#x201D;
	
		Orlando has been involved in the primitive skills community for over 25 years and has been to similar events across the country. When asked how the subculture has changed during that time, he noted, &#x201C;When I first started going to these things, there just wasn&#x2019;t a lot of good information out there. You could dig through books and libraries to try and find something, but there was no bible of primitive skills or anything.&#x201D; 
	
	These days, a simple internet search returns a wealth of books and articles on survival skills, indicating that this community&#x2019;s passion has had an effect.
	
	But Orlando doesn&#x2019;t think the technology of the Information Age is going to be what saves these traditions in the long run. &#x201C;Kids in their teens and early twenties, they&#x2019;re just plugged in all the time. If you don&#x2019;t have that connection to the woods, fields and natural environments, then you don&#x2019;t value it &#x2014; and then you don&#x2019;t feel a need to protect it.&#x201D;
	
	Although there wasn&#x2019;t much talk of doomsday prepping, the implication that the majority of contemporary society would be unable fend for itself, should catastrophe strike, was clear. 
	
	&#x201C;I put very little faith in society&#x2019;s trajectory, and there&#x2019;s very little between us and being forced to go back and learn these [skills],&#x201D; Orlando said.  
	
	Without hands-on training, the skills that helped us survive outside the shell of modern society are a generation away from being lost for good. 
	
	&#x201C;If we don&#x2019;t pass them on,&#x201D; Orlando said, &#x201C;they could be gone forever.&#x201D;  
	
	The Rivercane Rendezvous Primitive Life Skills Workshop will be held in Westminster, South Carolina April 16&#x2013;22, and will cover similar topics.

    <title>After Three Wins, Grasshoppers Drop First of 2018</title>
    <subhead>Hoppers No.2 in Sally League Standings</subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>GREENSBORO&#x2014;The Hoppers dropped their first of the season Monday, falling 7-4 to Augusta despite a feverish rally attempted in the cold hours of the ninth. 
	
	Greensboro&#x2019;s offense was strangely moribund against Joey Marciano and Peter Lannoo, with the home crowd offering little more than ambient noise following the first-inning quick strikes of the GreenJackets. 
	
	Malique Ziegler homered on the first pitch from Taylor Braley and Ryan Kirby emphasized things with a two-run bomb three batters later. 
	
	Braley lasted three more innings and allowed two more runs, neither earned. 
	
	Third baseman J.C. Millan&#x2019;s error opened up the third for Augusta, leading to an RBI knock by Shane Matheny. 
	
	Jhonny Santos picked up an undeserved error on the play, having gathered Matheny&#x2019;s ball in center and hurled a beautiful one-hopper toward home that handcuffed catcher B.J. L&#xF3;pez. A frustrated L&#xF3;pez glanced up unbelievingly and pounded a clenched fist into his mitt. 
	
	Lefties Nestor Bautista and Manny Rodr&#xED;guez each tossed two scoreless for Greensboro. Bautista struck out three in relief of Braley and Rodr&#xED;guez K&#x2019;d four in relief of Reilly Hovis, who allowed the visitors to tack on two runs in the seventh, one of which courtesy of another Matheny single. 
	
	Things only became complicated for the Jackets upon the appearance of Camilo Doval in the ninth. Doval walked two and allowed four hits before he could record a third out, in the end giving way to John Russell. 
	
	The lone Hoppers run against the starter Marciano came in the third on Sam Castro&#x2019;s bloop single scoring Zach Sullivan. Micah Brown and Eric Gutierrez notched BI in that eventful ninth.
	
	Edward Cabrera, per MLB.com the sixth-ranked pitcher in the Marlins system, takes the hill Tuesday as the home team tries to bounce back. 
	
	The Grasshoppers won their season opener at home against the Hickory Crawdads, taking three of three games from their Northern Division neighbors. Inclement weather postponed a game Saturday, April 7.
	
	As of Tuesday morning, Greensboro was one and a half games behind the leader of the (Double-A) South Atlantic League's Northern Division. Atop the Sally League board Tuesday morning were the Delmarva Shorebirds, the Baltimore Orioles-affiliated club that has won its first five games in 2018.</body>

	(HEALTH) &lt;span class="Y0NH2b CLPzrc"&gt;&#x2014;&lt;/span&gt; The results of a study conducted jointly by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the University of Wisconsin released this week revealed that Orange County&#x2019;s income inequality gap surpasses that of any other county in North Carolina with a population greater than 100,000.  The study broke down poverty rates by ethnicity, which indicated that only 4 percent of white children lived below the poverty line, while black and Hispanic children suffer poverty at 25 and 32 percent, respectively.
	
	(SPORTS)  &lt;span class="Y0NH2b CLPzrc"&gt;&#x2014; &lt;/span&gt;Brianna Duncan, a sophomore at the University of North Carolina, managed to break a school campus track and field record that had which stood for 27 years on Friday, April 6 as part of the &#x201C;Battle of the Blues&#x201D; event held at Duke.  Duncan ran the women&#x2019;s 100-meter dash in 11.35 seconds, beating Kendra Mackey&#x2019;s previous record of 11.73 seconds, set in 1991.  She is also the current holder of UNC&#x2019;s 60-meter dash record.

Most of the participants were dressed in white shirts and white pants with red stains in the groin area.  The group claims that infant circumcision of boys is a human rights violation and not supported by medical science. &lt;br&gt;

	(GOVERNMENT) &lt;span class="Y0NH2b CLPzrc"&gt;&#x2014; &lt;/span&gt;The Durham City Council&#x2019;s work session on Thursday, April 5, produced  an official press release formally rejecting any future plans to allow police be trained in advanced military tactics and weaponry by the Israeli army.  The announcement was in direct response to a recent petition circulated in the community by 10 local social justice organizations demanding the department cut any and all ties with Israel, asserting that such practices would only increase incidents of excessive of force and racial profiling.   
	
	(CRIME) &lt;span class="Y0NH2b CLPzrc"&gt;&#x2014; &lt;/span&gt;Durham novelist and convicted murderer Michael Peterson is in the headlines again this week in anticipation of the Investigation Discovery cable channel&#x2019;s three-part documentary special, &#x201C;American Murder Mystery: The Staircase&#x201D;, set to debut the night of Sunday, April 8.  Peterson was convicted of murdering his wife Kathleen in 2003, but copped an Alford plea (a legal concept wherein a defendant pleads guilty without admitting guilt) in 2017, which reduced his charge to manslaughter and freed him from prison.  
	
	      
	
	(CRIME) &lt;span class="Y0NH2b CLPzrc"&gt;&#x2014; &lt;/span&gt;Police have identified and filed charges against the woman who was allegedly witnessed slashing the throat of a fellow passenger on a GoDurham bus on March 15.  However, Naisha Moena has yet to be taken into custody, and Durham police are still soliciting information from the public in an effort to locate her.  Anyone with knowledge of her whereabouts is encouraged to contact Investigator Junker at (919)-560-4935.
	
	(BASKETBALL)&lt;span class="Y0NH2b CLPzrc"&gt; &#x2014;&lt;/span&gt; Duke freshman shooting guard Gary Trent Jr. announced his plan to hire an agent and enter the 2018 NBA draft, making him the third Blue Devil this year to make the jump.  Both Marvin Bagley and Trevon Duval will also be on the draft list.  In a video posted to his Twitter page, Trent thanked the university for giving him a chance to play.

The footage, taken on Tuesday, April 3, was filmed during a public commentary on the issue of an upcoming gun and knife show to be held in Greensboro Coliseum.  City resident Mark Robinson asked the council pointed rhetorical questions about the constitutional rights of law-abiding gun owners.  The video initially gained attention when U.S. Rep. Mark Walker of North Carolina&#x2019;s 6th congressional district shared it on his Facebook page.

Moore had been accused by multiple women of sexual assault, with many incidents occurring when the victims were was under the legal age of consent.  Moore denied all the allegations.

	&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Orange County&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;
	
	(SPORTS) &#x2014; Friends, family and fans celebrated the life of former UNC Chapel Hill play-by-play sports announcer Woody Durham at a public memorial service on Sunday, April 8. Durham, who died last month at the age of 76, was eulogized by those who knew him well. Governor Roy Cooper made the trip from Raleigh to say a few words as well. Durham spent 40 years as the voice of Tar Heel football and basketball and was the recipient of the NC Sportscaster of the Year award on thirteen occasions.&lt;br&gt;
	
	(CRIME) &#x2014; The Chapel Hill-Carrboro City Schools system sent a message to all parents with children attending Seawell Elementary, Smith Middle and Chapel Hill High on Monday, April 9, informing them of an ongoing threat investigation. Earlier in the day, a group of girls reported that they had been approached by a man and a woman not far from the schools&#x2019; grounds (all three campuses are on Seawell School Road). According to reports, they said the man told them he would return on Tuesday to shoot students and that he had a gun in his backpack. Police responded by increasing their presence at all three schools. No shooting occurred.
	
	(DEVELOPMENT) &#x2014; The North Carolina Department of Transportation sent out a press release on Monday, April 9, informing residents of Orange County that the University Station Road bridge, which crosses Stony Creek just south of I-85, will be closed until early August. Constructed in 1956, the bridge has long been slated for renovation, and NCDOT officials said the bridge &#x201C;no longer meets the demands of the traffic using it and has reached the end of its life cycle.&#x201D; Detours will be established along U.S. 70, Old NC 10 and Lawrence Road.
	
	(COMMUNITY) Carrboro hosted its sixth annual Open Streets festival this past Sunday, April 8, closing down East and West Weaver Streets to all automobile traffic for the morning and afternoon. Local businesses were encouraged to set up booths and offer activities as a way of connecting with locals and students. And despite the chilly weather, the crowd numbered in the hundreds. Open Streets is a free event organized by the Carrboro Recreation &amp;amp; Parks Department.

	(CRIME) &#x2014; Durham city police have been warning the public about what they see as an alarming trend this past week &#x2014; the so-called &#x201C;Paintball Wars.&#x201D; Between April 3 and 10, the department has received 14 calls reporting the discharge of a paintball gun (which is illegal within municipal limits) and damage to property. Two arrests have been made in connection with one of these calls.
	
	(BUSINESS) &#x2014; It was reported this week that the privately held real estate company Samco Properties outbid Big Lots to lease the location of the now-bankrupt Toys R Us on Westgate Drive in Durham. The lease, which closed at $800,000, was being auctioned off as part of the retail toy outlet&#x2019;s bankruptcy settlement. Samco representatives expect to have a new tenant&#x2019;s contract signed within two weeks, but have not yet identified a business. 
	
	(CRIME) &#x2014; The Durham County Sheriff&#x2019;s office is planning to execute a second search warrant at 9706 Rougemont Road in the unincorporated neighborhood known as Bahama in northern Durham county, to investigate how a missing three-year-old girl ended up unconscious in a creek near the property on Monday, April 9. The girl was a resident of the location, along with her father, who called 911 to report his daughter&#x2019;s disappearance at 1:33 PM on Monday. She is currently in critical condition at a local hospital.
	
	(BUSINESS) &#x2014;Durham restaurant Finch&#x2019;s will close after only six months at its new location. Finch&#x2019;s had operated for 70 years on Peace Street in Raleigh, but was priced out of its flagship location as development around Capital Boulevard amped up. An eatery with the name East Cut will be taking over the current location on Old Chapel Hill Road. Finch&#x2019;s was best known for its old-school diner ambience and breakfast food.

	(MARKET) &#x2014; Four extremely rare star rubies, originally mined near Asheville, were added to the catalogue of the prestigious Guernsey&#x2019;s auction house this past week. Amateur geologist Jarvis Wayne Messer discovered the gemstones in 1990. The stones were given their name because of the star-like pattern and sheen. Star rubies are considered even more rare than diamonds, and Messer&#x2019;s collection has been appraised at $100 million. They weigh a total of 342 carats and are available for sale prior to the auction. </body>

	(HEALTH) &#x2014; The North Carolina Policy Collaboratory, a group established in 2016 to harness the research capabilities of UNC for the benefit of state and municipal governments, announced this week they will award of $430,000 in grants to research levels of contamination in North Carolina water supplies. Much of the funding will be used to test for the chemical known as GenX, which the DuPont corporation began disposing of in the Cape Fear river around 1980. 
	
	(SPORTS) &#x2014; Emails released Friday, April 13, through an Associated Press public records request revealed that UNC officials made contact with the North Carolina Secretary of State&#x2019;s office in 2014, 2016 and 2017 in reference to improper conduct of National Football League recruiting agents. The emails suggested that at least five agents attempted to make contact directly with students instead of going through a university-assigned intermediary. The Uniform Athlete Agent Act (UAAA) has required the use of an agent advisor since 2010. 
	
	(COMMUNITY) &#x2013; The Orange County Sheriff&#x2019;s Office was named this week by Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) as North Carolina&#x2019;s &#x201C;Agency of the Year.&#x201D; The award, which was bestowed at a banquet in Cary, also singled out Sheriff Charles Blackwood for his efforts at keeping the roads safe by requiring his deputies to be certified chemical analysts as well as radar and lidar (light and radar) operators. MADD itself makes the initial nominations, after which a committee of law enforcement and criminal justice professionals make the final selection.
	
	(GOVERNMENT) &#x2014; Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the federal agency within the U.S. Department of Homeland Security charged with serving deportation warrants, made 10 arrests in Orange and Chatham county this week, with three separate raids being confirmed in Hillsborough, Chapel Hill and Carrboro. News of the raids initially became public through the Facebook posts of Hispanic community liaison organization El Centro Hispano. ICE&#x2019;s Southern Region communications director Bryan Cox spoke with the Sundial via phone Friday and said, &#x201C;The majority of those targeted for arrest have criminal convictions beyond anything to do with their immigration status... The existence of ICE activities in the area this week isn&#x2019;t anything outside the norm of what ICE does on a daily basis.&#x201D;

    <title>Baseball Comes Home to Dash City</title>
    <subhead></subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>WINSTON-SALEM&#x2014;Minor league baseball returned for the 2018 season and the Dash pushed to the top of the Carolina League&#x2019;s Southern Division, winning in their first two home games of 2018. Baseball correspondent Ben Spanier broke down a brace of games that showed two very different ways of winning in the minor leagues. 
	
	The Dash of the Class-A Carolina League showed a flair for winning in this, the early season of minor league baseball in 2018. The czars of the Chicago White Sox farm system have stocked their Triad-area affiliate with some handy prospects, and under the helm of manager Omar Visquel, the Dash have proven in a pair of home games that they are here to play hardy baseball.
	
	&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Thursday&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
	
	The Dash are off to a pulsing start in 2018, opening their home schedule with a walk-off 3-2 win Thursday over the Carolina Mudcats that was settled with a steal of home by 24-year-old Joel Booker. 
	
	The win over the Mudcats brings the Dash to 5-3 overall, a decent enough start for a talent-laden squad that should have a shot at playoff contention, and no few of whose roster members should merit or promotion to the higher tiers of White Sox farm system. 
	
	Thursday's win pulled the Dash even with the Mudcats for first place in the Carolina League&#x2019;s Southern Division.
	
	Lefty Bernardo Flores did his part, keeping the Mudcats off-balance for six innings, racking up five strikeouts and surrendering only two runs despite allowing nine hits. The Mudcats&#x2019; one-two punch of Clint Coulter&#x2019;s double and Ronnie Gideon&#x2019;s home run in the sixth landed the only blow on Flores.  Keston Hiura, the Milwaukee Brewers&#x2019; top prospect, tallied three hits, including a triple. 
	
	The Dash were kept down through five innings by the Mudcats&#x2019; Trey Supak and through the next three by Conor Harber, though they did manage to scratch across just enough to force a test of the new extra-inning protocols. The Dash scored one in the third when Alex Call yanked a double down the left-field line and scored on a single by Gavin Sheets, last year&#x2019;s second-round draft pick out of Wake Forest. The second Dash score came in the eighth on an RBI double by Ti&#x2019;Quan Forbes that brought home Yeyson Yrizzari. 
	
	The Dash&#x2019;s&#x201C;rally&#x201D; in the tenth was initiated, if you can say that, by the placement of Joel Booker on second base (pinch-running for Sheets, the final out in the ninth.) Minor League Baseball has adopted rules that corrupt baseball&#x2019;s long-standing extra-inning rules by installing a baserunner at second to lead off every frame of an extra-inning game. 
	
	So, when the bottom of the tenth inning began, Winston Salem&#x2019;s Gavin Sheets walked out and took his place as a baserunner at second. As odd as it may seem, these are now the rules of baseball, akin to rules that stand at much lower level of the game, the staging of &#x201C;ghost runners&#x201D; that children designate in lots and schoolyards when a full lineup cannot be mustered.
	
	Thursday&#x2019;s tenth-inning tizzy included an attempt at&#x2014;why not&#x2014;the hidden ball trick, and ended with Booker&#x2019;s mad dash home, a walk-away run for the home team. 
	
	When the Dash came to bat in the tenth, Winston-Salem Manager Omar Visquel promptly replaced Sheets at second with pinch-runner Booker. The inning&#x2019;s first batter, Micker Adolfo, struck out, and the second, Yermin Mercedes, lined out to center.
	
	But, one out away from the safety zone of an eleventh inning, Mudcats reliever Daniel Brown gave up a hit to Yrizarri that sent Booker to third. Brown then walked Forbes to load the bases.
	
	That dizzying final play was completed on the heels of some confusion on the field, stemming from the Mudcats&#x2019; attempt to pull off the hidden ball trick. It was after a mound conference with Mudcats manager Joe Ayrault and the Carolina infield that the game took a turn for the truly unexpected.
	
	Brown and a few others knew what was afoot, but as he lingered on the mound without coming set, the lull in action produced quizzical expressions among players. A play on Yrizarri at second was nullified. The batter, Mitch Roman, protested that time was still called, and home plate umpire Reed Basner seemed to agree. There was no call on the play, which was unofficial because time was called while the trick was attempted.
	
	This disjointment of the game&#x2019;s rhythm allowed the speedy Booker to capitalize on the thrown-off pace, and cut in on the fun Brown and his infield were trying to have. No play can be more in-your-eye than to steal home plate on a pitch delivery. Booker stole home on the second pitch to Roman for the win.
	
	It is possible Booker had gotten the green-light to steal home when he was sent out to substitute for Sheets as the runner at second, or while leading from third via a whisper in the ear from Manager Visquel, who stood behind Booker coaching third base (a position many managers take up during games in the minor leagues). 
	
	Booker dashed home for the walk-off win, but could hardly make it off the field for the scrum of Winston-Salem players who mobbed him at home plate. 
	
	A speedy baserunner himself during his 24-year career, Visquel stole 404 bags in the major leagues. On the strength of his dazzling glove at shortstop, Vizquel is in the Hall-of-Fame conversation as a player. Is a lengthy managerial career in the offing for Winston-Salem&#x2019;s skipper?
	
	&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Friday&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
	
	The Dash cruised to victory Friday night in their home digs at BB&amp;amp;T Ballpark, routing the Mudcats, 8-1, behind an outstanding Dylan Cease performance.
	
	Cease&#x2019;s fastball sat at 96 and hit 99, and Cease occasionally used a curveball, slider or changeup as he notched five K&#x2019;s against two hits over six scoreless innings.
	
	The lean right-hander from Milton, Georgia was a secondary piece in last year&#x2019;s Quintana-Jim&#xE9;nez deal, a cross-town swap that saw the Dash&#x2019;s parent club Chicago White Sox trade starting pitcher Jose Quintana to the Cubs for outfield prospect Eloy Jimenez.
	
	Cease, per MLB Pipeline, is the third-ranked pitcher in a loaded White Sox minor league system.
	
	Mudcats starter Nathan Kirby had a short one Friday, lasting only an inning and a third as the Dash pushed four runs across on four hits and two walks. Micker Adolfo led off the frame with a solid single to center. Choppers by Gavin Sheets and Ti&#x2019;Quan Forbes cashed him in.
	
	The second run came on a bases-loaded walk, and the third and fourth came together on a knock by Luis Basabe off reliever V&#xED;ctor D&#xED;az.
	
	The lefty Kirby may feel just a little snake-bit, after a couple of soft hits and a couple of inherited runners did him in. The Dash all but ended it with a four-run fifth, a hit parade punctuated by Joel Booker&#x2019;s hustling RBI double, Adolfo&#x2019;s two-run knock, and a beautiful piece of hitting by Sheets on an RBI double inside-outed down the left-field line. The Mudcats scored their lone run on a solo shot in the eighth by Clint Coulter.
	
	Friday was a promising night not just for Cease, but for a few exceptionally talented hitting prospects as well. Outfielders Adolfo and Basabe have not quite lived up to expectations yet, due respectively to injuries and ineffectiveness.
	
	The statuesque Adolfo (the night&#x2019;s designated hitter) had a couple of solid singles and a hard line-out to left, while the lithe Basabe collected three hits, including a double and a nice drag bunt, as well as a couple of nice plays in left field. Sheets also showed out on both sides of the ball, making a diving stab at first in addition to his two knocks.
	
	Thursday&#x2019;s hero for a steal home to win the Dash&#x2019;s home opener, Booker showed up in his cleats again Friday, with two hits (to keep up his league-leading batting line) and his stellar centerfield play.</body>

	(TRAFFIC) &#x2014; The pedestrian footbridge located near 125 East Rosemary Street in Chapel was struck by an Orange County solid waste disposal truck on Sunday, April 15 at 6:07 AM. No injuries were reported, but both the 100 block of East Rosemary and the bridge itself will be closed to the public until further notice. An official press release from the town of Chapel Hill stated that all of the nearby business and parking structures will remain open and operational in the meantime. 
	
	(HEALTH) &#x2014; Sex toy and prophylactic company Adam &amp;amp; Eve released the findings of its latest survey on the sexual behavior and proclivities of American teenagers on Thursday, April 12. Statistics include age of first sexual experience and whether teens prefer that sex education come from school or from home.  Adam &amp;amp; Eve is the largest employer in the town of Hillsborough, where it has been headquartered since its founding by physicians Tim Black and Phil Harvey in 1970. A PDF file using the survey and related research is available &lt;a href="https://www.adameve.com/t-infographic-teen-sex.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;on their website.&lt;/a&gt; 
	
	(DEVELOPMENT) &#x2014; Concerned citizens presented a petition to Chapel Hill&#x2019;s town council last week asking officials to address concerns about the development of a land parcel adjacent to Estes Drive between Somerset Drive and Phillips Middle School. The once-wooded area was recently clear cut to make room for a planned retirement community scheduled to begin construction in March of 2019. Local residents, who also circulated a letter on April 8 outlining the same issues, are worried about the developer&#x2019;s potential use of rock blasting, which they fear may damage their homes.  
	
	(SPORTS) &#x2014; The UNC-Chapel Hill women&#x2019;s tennis team, currently ranked first in the nation, shut out the University of Virginia, 7-0, on Friday, April 13. Star players included junior Chloe Ouellet-Pizer and sophomore Alexa Graham, each of whom won their singles matches. The Tar Heels doubles teams won two matches, 6-2 and 6-4, and tied one at 5-5. UNC has only two regular-season matches left before the ACC championships.

No charges have been filed as of this publication, and a homicide investigation is ongoing. Anyone who may have pertinent information is encouraged to call investigators at 919-560-4440.
	
	(COMMUNITY) &#x2014; Durham Mayor Steve Schewel released an official statement Monday, April 16 denouncing the Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids last week that resulted in the detainment of 25 individuals residing illegally in the Research Triangle. &#x201C;We embrace every Durham resident regardless of documentation status, and we do not want ICE striking fear in our community,&#x201D; Schewel wrote. City Council member Charlie Reece also spoke out against the raids on his Facebook page, writing, &#x201C;To be clear: no one with the city of Durham was notified that these raids would be taking place in our city.&#x201D;
	
	(CRIME) &#x2014; Durham police have charged 18-year-old Steven Watts with arson in connection with a fire at the Treyburn Country Club&#x2019;s tennis courts on Sunday, April 15. Firefighters responded to the call at 1 Old Trail Drive around 4 AM that morning and had the fire under control about an hour later. Despite the arrest, detectives claim the investigation is still ongoing as they continue to process evidence and search for witnesses. 
	
	(SPORTS) &#x2014; Duke University learned this Monday, April 16 that it has lost another undergraduate basketball player to the National Basketball Association when freshman Wendell Carter Jr. updated his Instagram account with a statement confirming his intention to enter the 2018 NBA draft. Atlanta native Carter helped lead the Blue Devils to the NCAA&#x2019;s final eight this season, and is the fourth Duke freshman this year to announce plans to go professional prior to completing college..

    <title>Sundial Lens: ICE Raids Detain NC Residents</title>
    <subhead></subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>Friends and family of 10 Orange and Chatham county residents were forced to say goodbye to loved ones on April 9, not knowing if or when they would ever reconnect to those detained for residing in the country illegally. Some were claimed while taking out the trash, while some may have been apprehended during raids aimed at another's detainment.&amp;nbsp;
	
	The raids, part of a larger sweep that picked up 25 individuals living in the Triangle without proper documentation, caught residents and local law enforcement by surprise and prompted community outrage.&lt;br&gt;
	
	Durham mayor Steve Schewel and Carrboro mayor Lydia Lavelle have both made public statements condemning last week&#x2019;s raids in the Triangle and voicing general support for local immigrant communities.
	
	"We embrace every Durham resident regardless of documentation status, and we do not want ICE striking fear in our community,&#x201D; Schewel wrote in a statement on April 15. &#x201C;We also want our community to know that the City of Durham Police Department does not cooperate with ICE in any way and does not receive advance notice of ICE activities in our city.&#x201D;
	
	Mayor Lavelle echoed these sentiments in her own &lt;a href="https://www.townofcarrboro.org/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=871" target="_blank"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; published on the Town of Carrboro website (and another statement in &lt;a href="https://www.townofcarrboro.org/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=875" target="_blank"&gt;Spanish).&lt;/a&gt; &#x201C;The Carrboro Board of Aldermen firmly believes that immigrants are an integral part of our community and should be welcomed and supported&#x2026; It is essential that all residents of Carrboro feel safe and secure, regardless of their national origin or immigration status, and that they receive due process and legal representation.&#x201D;
	
	In a recent development, The Church of Reconciliation in Chapel Hill has joined forces with the Chapel Hill Mennonite fellowship to offer sanctuary to Rosa del Carmen Ortez-Cruz, a mother of four who came to the United States from Honduras and fears for her safety if deported. 
	
	 The Sundial spoke with Captain J. Mecimore of Chapel Hill PD, who stated that the churches&#x2019; decision is a non-issue from his perspective.
	
	&#x201C;There is no connection to the Chapel Hill Police Department. We do not enforce federal immigration rules or laws; it&#x2019;s not our purview,&#x201D; Mecimore said. A religious group granting physical refuge from ICE agents is not in violation of any North Carolina statutes or local ordinances, according to Mecimore.
	
	ICE is authorized to provide immigration enforcement training to local police under a program called ICE ACCESS, short for Agreements of Cooperation in Communities to Enhance Safety and Security. Neither the Chapel Hill nor the Carrboro police departments have participated in this program. The Durham police department has not responded to inquiries as of this publication.
	
	A Triangle police contact who asked to remain nameless reinforced the notion of noncooperation, explaining that most law enforcement agencies in Orange and Chatham counties will not, as a matter of policy, hold arrestees for ICE without an order from a judge, unless the individual was picked up for an &#x201C;index crime.&#x201D; Index crime is defined as a serious crime committed against person or property that is reported (indexed) to the FBI for inclusion in their annual Uniform Crime Report. These crimes include murder, rape, aggravated assault, arson and grand theft auto.   
	
	&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Larger Lens&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
	
	Bryan Cox, the communications specialist for ICE&#x2019;s Atlanta field office,&#xD;
 which serves Georgia and the Carolinas, told the Sundial, &#x201C;ICE &#xD;
continues to focus its limited resources first and foremost on those who&#xD;
 pose the greatest threat to public safety, and any suggestions as to &#xD;
ICE engaging in random or indiscriminate enforcement are categorically &#xD;
false. The agency&#x2019;s arrest stats clearly reflect this reality.&#x201D;
	
	Of the 8,886 immigrants detained in 2016 within Georgia and the Carolinas, 88 percent had additional criminal convictions. However, the percentage for 2017 dropped to 67. The percentage rates for 2014 and 2015 were 75 and 90 respectively.
	
	&#x201C;Nationally, 92 percent of all persons arrested by ICE in 2017 either had a criminal conviction, a pending criminal charge, or [they] were already subject to a removal order issued by a federal immigration judge,&#x201D; Cox wrote over email.&lt;br&gt;The Obama administration faced heavy criticism &#xD;
for the high number of deportations that took place under its watch &#xD;
despite Obama&#x2019;s openly expressing a desire to de-prioritize the &#xD;
expulsion of non-criminals and his cabinet&#x2019;s advocacy of the DREAM Act &#xD;
providing a path to legal status of those brought to America as &#xD;
juveniles. A &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/07/us/more-deportations-follow-minor-crimes-data-shows.html" target="_blank"&gt;New York Times investigation&lt;/a&gt; reported that two-thirds of &#xD;
Obama&#x2019;s deportations as of April 2014 involved persons either charged &#xD;
with petty infractions like traffic violations or without a record &#xD;
(other than their immigration status).&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;President&#xD;
 Trump, who made decreasing illegal immigration a key campaign talking &#xD;
point in the 2016 election, has overseen 3,500 more ICE arrests in our &#xD;
district in 2017 than Obama did during his final year in office.
	
	As&#xD;
 a federal agency, ICE&#x2019;s jurisdiction supersedes municipal, county and &#xD;
state authority. Whether ICE chooses to inform area law enforcement &#xD;
agencies prior to a raid is solely a matter of strategy. Some local &#xD;
police departments or sheriff&#x2019;s offices may be more sympathetic to the &#xD;
agency&#x2019;s goals than others. An incident this past February in which &#xD;
Oakland, California Mayor Libby Schaaf warned Bay Area residents of a &#xD;
planned ICE sweep on live television four days before it was scheduled &#xD;
to occur indicates that noncooperation remains a legitimate concern.Prior to the creation of ICE in 2002, agents of the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) monitored visa expirations, patrolled the border and deported foreigners living stateside without permission. These agents had duties beyond law enforcement, however, including guiding recent arrivals on their path to citizenship and arbitrating requests for permanent resident status. First implemented in 1933 during Franklin Roosevelt&#x2019;s first term as president, the INS served the American government in this capacity for 70 years, until 9/11 demanded an overhaul of the nation&#x2019;s defense apparatus. After 9/11&#x2019;s unprecedented destruction under the noses of one of the world&#x2019;s most sophisticated intelligence communities, the George W. Bush administration and both houses of Congress took steps to reorganize every bureau involved in counter-terror efforts under the umbrella of the Department of Homeland Security. This reshuffle was designed to facilitate sharing of information and to reduce inter-department competition. 
	
	As such, the INS&#x2019; law enforcement responsibilities were separated from its authority to adjudicate immigration status and grant residency permits. From its ashes rose three new, yet-living agencies: ICE, which combined the investigative and deportation arm of the INS with U.S customs detectives; U.S. Citizen and Immigration Services, which handles the path-to-citizenship process for those here legally; and U.S. Customs and Border Protection, which regulates the movement of people and goods into and out of the country. 
	
	ICE has much more on its plate than tracking and detaining undocumented people. The &#x201C;customs&#x201D; part of their job refers to the collection of duties on imported goods, as well as the inspection of luggage coming into the country. The agency also pours resources into recovering stolen art and antiquities, breaking up human trafficking rings and preventing off-shore financial fraud. </body>

	(CRIME)  &#x2014; A teaching assistant at Northside Elementary School in Chapel Hill has been arrested in connection with the murder of Michael Thomas Le at a sweepstakes parlor in Burlington. Le was killed during a robbery of the establishment on April 8, where he was employed as security, and a female Northside faculty member was arrested the following day along with three males who were also alleged to have been involved. Burlington police are actively searching for an additional suspect. Anyone with information is encouraged to call Alamance Crime Stoppers at 336-229-7100.
	
	(GOVERNMENT)  &#x2014; The Carrboro Police Department presented a report on racial bias at the town&#x2019;s Tuesday, April 17 Board of Alderman meeting, having spent the past two years examining their internal statistics detailing traffic and equipment/regulatory stop between 2012 and 2017. When examining the demographics of those pulled over and the actions resulting from the stops, no bias was deemed present by the analyst hired by Carrboro PD. Chief Walter Horton told the board that his department is also attempting to make fewer marijuana arrests.
	
	(EDUCATION)  &#x2014; Governor Roy Cooper made an appearance at Cedar Ridge High School to announce his &#x201C;Safer Schools, Healthier Kids&#x201D; proposal, which will require $130 million to implement. Half of that sum would be placed into a reserve fund accessible only to schools choosing to upgrade campus security systems. Another $10 million would be used to hire more school resource officers, and $40 million would be used for training 500 new student support service employees, such as counselors and consultants.
	
	(DEVELOPMENT)  &#x2014; Duke Energy employees have spent this past week knocking on doors in Chapel Hill asking residents enroll in their new EnergyWise Home program. Any household choosing to join the program will be added to a list of homes in which power use can be restricted during moments of peak demand. Of Duke Energy&#x2019;s 7.4 million clients, 170,000 are currently enrolled in markets outside Orange County . The plan is intended to save money and reduce the environmental impact of fossil fuels. &lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Durham&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;(CRIME)  &#x2014; A Durham man was arrested this week in connection with two separate knife-point robberies of taxi drivers that occurred last weekend. The victims in both incidents, which took place in the 600 block of Burlington Avenue and at the intersection of East Cornwallis and East Weaver, attempted to fight the robber off with their bare hands, resulting in a serious injury to one of the drivers. Police were able to track the suspect down using phone records.  
	
	(DEVELOPMENT)  &#x2014; The planned construction of a roundabout at the intersection of Hope Valley Road and University Drive is already coming under fire from local property owners and companies who maintain that they will not be properly compensated for required alterations nor reductions in business. Both Epworth United Methodist Church and the Maxwell, Freeman &amp;amp; Bowman law firm have publicly expressed concern about the project. According to the North Carolina Department of Transportation, 19,000 vehicles pass through the intersection daily, and the number is expected to grow 16 percent in the next quarter-century.

Around 900 evictions a month are filed with the city, and evictions &#x201C;disproportionately affect lower-income neighborhoods; it seems convincing that the rise in evictions and the simultaneous gentrification of low-income regions are related," said Standaert. Recommendations include the creation of an eviction crisis task force, and financially supporting a maintenance fund available for any resident to draw from for repairs.  
	
	(SPORTS) &#x2013;Third-ranked Duke baseball team lost to second-ranked North Carolina State, 9-2, this past Friday at Coombs Field.

    <title>Baseball: Greensboro Takes 3 of 4 at Home</title>
    <subhead></subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>GREENSBORO &#x2014; The Grasshoppers wrapped up a home stand against cross-division rivals over the weekend, as baseball in the South American League begins to simmer in the ramp-up to what looks to be a blazing summer of baseball. 
	
	The Hoppers and their weekend series opponents, the Charleston RiverDogs of the Southern Division, were at rest Monday with rain across the southeast postponing baseball games up the minor-league staircase. 
	
	Tuesday skies permitting, the Hoppers will play on a road trip across North Carolina&#x2019;s Catawba River against the Hickory Crawdads. 
	
	The RiverDogs were set to play Monday&#x2019;s postponed game in Charleston as part of a special home-opener doubleheader Tuesday starting at 6:05 PM.
	
	UPDATE:&amp;nbsp; Tuesday's game between the Greensboro Grasshoppers and Hickory Crawdads was postponed due to rain. &lt;br&gt;
	
	&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Thursday&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
	
	The Hoppers walked off with a 3-2 win upon their return home to First National Bank Park on Thursday. A bases-loaded single by Eric Gutierrez felled the Charleston Riverdogs in the ninth inning to cap the first game the Yankees affiliate from South Carolina has played in Greensboro since 2013. 
	
	Charleston scored two runs in the eighth to pull even with Greensboro&#x2019;s lead, but Gutierrez&#x2019;s bat gave the Grasshoppers the win. 
	
	Starting pitcher Ryan Lillie was dominant for the home team, striking out eight over seven innings of two-hit work. Right-hander Nick Nelson, 22, also worked briskly on this wintry night in April, allowing two runs over six and striking out seven, and was pulled off the hook when his teammate Jason L&#xF3;pez tied the game with a two-run homer in the eighth. 
	
	Greensboro put together a two-out rally in the fourth inning. Micah Brown rapped a double for his second hit and scored when Michael Hernandez repeated the feat. 
	
	The Hoppers scored again in the fifth on an RBI groundout by Gutierrez, who had two hits in addition to his two ribbies. This first-and-third scenario was set up by Aaron Knapp&#x2019;s base-on-balls and a hit-and-run executed by Jos&#xE9; Devers. Devers laid a humpback liner on the grass just beyond the abandoned position of the shortstop who had shifted cover second base. 
	
	Devers, 18, highlighted his Sally League debut with that piece of hitting and in the field with a diving snare of a liner off the bat of Charleston&#x2019;s Wilkerman Garc&#xED;a in the third, robbing the Venezuelan of his second hit. 
	
	Recently a top prospect, Garc&#xED;a gave some and took some away from Charleston in the field, sparkling at shortstop with arm range on some plays, and making errors on others. 
	
	Leonardo Molina doubled and Jason L&#xF3;pez tied the game in the eighth with an opposite field bomb off R.J. Peace, while Greg Weissert struck out four over two and two-thirds innings for the RiverDogs. 
	
	&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Friday&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
	
	The Hoppers won their ninth game in 2018 on Friday, landing the last blow in a pitchers&#x2019; duel with Charleston 2-1. Greensboro&#x2019;s Taylor Braley was just a bit better than the Riverdogs&#x2019; Dalton Lehnen, allowing one run on seven hits over seven to the lefty&#x2019;s two runs allowed on five hits over six-and-two-thirds. Each team&#x2019;s starting pitcher notched nine strikeouts. 
	
	Charleston&#x2019;s best chance came in the third, when Ricardo Ferreira, Oswaldo Cabrera, and Steven Sensley all singled &#x2014; but a mixture of bad base-running and bad luck kept the visitors off the board. Cabrera&#x2019;s knock struck a running Ferreira and Sensley was caught unawares on a back-pick by catcher B. J. L&#xF3;pez. 
	
	RiverDogs batters collected ten hits but could only scratch up a single run on Greensboro pitchers, who escaped from jams in the first, third and eighth. Charleston&#x2019;s run came on a sixth-inning solo homer by Chris Hess. 
	
	Greensboro also scored theirs in the sixth inning. Aaron Knapp tripled and then scored on a single by Jos&#xE9; Devers. 
	
	Devers, cousin of Boston Red Sox third baseman Rafael Devers, scored the go-ahead run by his own handiwork, advancing to second on a passed ball, stealing third, then coming home on a wild pitch. The 18-year-old from Saman&#xE1;, Dominican Republic, was a major piece in this winter&#x2019;s deal between Greensboro and Charleston's major league affiliates, which saw Giancarlo Stanton traded from Miami to New York. 
	
	The RiverDogs had one more shot in the eighth against reliever Dustin Beggs, when singles by Ferreira and Cabrera were foiled by two strikeouts and a runner caught stealing. 
	
	Under-the-radar prospects in a deep Yankees system Leonardo Molina and Sensley had encouraging nights, both with two hits and Sensley with a long fly-out to center that might have carried out of the park upon the air on a warmer summer night. 
	
	&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Saturday&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
	
	Charleston beat Greensboro 4-2 Saturday on an oddly tense night in Sally League baseball, when tempers flared at the ballpark on Bellemeade Street. 
	
	Benches cleared in the bottom of the sixth and both sides were warned when a disagreement ensued between opposing managers about a ball that left the dirt and hit the bat of Grasshopper Garvis Lara. 
	
	With nobody on and nobody out, Lara struck out on a breaking ball that bounced up and nicked Lara&#x2019;s bat. RiverDogs manager Julio Mosquera leapt immediately from the visitors&#x2019; dugout to protest that this was a deliberate maneuver on the part of the batsman and was successful in convincing the men in blue that this was the case. 
	
	Charleston put together a four-run lead, piecemeal &#x2014; one run at a time &#x2014; in the first, third, sixth and seventh innings. The RiverDogs&#x2019; first three runs came off Edward Cabrera, first blood drawn courtesy of Wilkerman Garc&#xED;a&#x2019;s homer to lead off the game. 
	
	The second run on Cabrera came in the third when Frederick Cuevas led off with a single, advanced to second on a wild pitch, and scored on a groundout by Oswaldo Cabrera. 
	
	The third run was unearned, Cabrera plunking Hess at the plate, who took third when centerfielder Aaron Knapp bobbled Leonardo Molina&#x2019;s single. The next action was a grounder snared impressively by third baseman Marcos Rivera, who botched the ensuing rundown by dropping the catcher&#x2019;s return throw and allowing Molina to score. 
	
	Cabrera lasted five and one-third and struck out four. 
	
	Steven Sensley struck out looking in the top of the seventh, his countenance as he left the box suggesting he thought the pitch was low. Next up, Chris Hess took a strike and glanced back at the home plate umpire just as Sensley had, but this time catcher Michael Hernandez returned the jawing. Something must&#x2019;ve been said, and the two players had to be separated.
	
	Bryce Howe allowed the last run on a two wild pitches following a walk and a stolen base by Garc&#xED;a. 
	
	Nestor Bautista pitched the last two innings for Greensboro, the only hiccup back-to-back doubles in the ninth by Garc&#xED;a and Cabrera. 
	
	Riverdogs pitching was lights-out for most of the night, J. P. Sears striking out five over four and Daniel Ramos K&#x2019;ing six over four and one-third and only faltering in his final inning of work. 
	
	Before Isael Soto walked and scored on a homer by Eric Gutierrez in the ninth, the only Hopper hits were sencillos by Soto and Jhonny Santos. Matt Wivinis got the final two outs to save it for the Dogs. 
	
	&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Sunday&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
	
	The Hoppers took three of four games at home against the Charleston RiverDogs, yet find themselves treading water in their own South Atlantic League North division.
	
	The Grasshoppers trail the Kannapolis Intimidators by half a game (Greensboro: 10-6; Kannapolis: 11-6) and the Delmarva Shorebirds, who possessed, as of Monday, a league-best record of 12-5. The RiverDogs scored early, but the Hoppers scored late after trailing 2-0 for seven innings.
	
	The tide turned during the home team&#x2019;s eighth offensive frame &#x2014; the Hoppers&#x2019; second-last chance to narrow the margin on what had until that point been an impeccable pitching staff of one &#x2014; Garrett Whitlock, the RiverDogs&#x2019; 21-year-old starting pitcher.
	
	 Whitlock pitched seven frames of scoreless baseball, giving up only two hits and striking out four of Greensboro&#x2019;s batters, who otherwise were stymied by the infield grounder.  
	
	But when Brian Trieglaff replaced Whitlock to begin the eighth inning, Grasshopper batsmen pounced on him like prey. B. J. Lopez singled to lead off the inning. Zach Sullivan bunted and reached base safely. Sam Castro bunted safely on Sullivan&#x2019;s heels to load the bases with no outs. Aaron Knapp singled and Jos&#xE9; Devers pushed a runner over with a GDP, and Israel Soto doubled to bring the third run home. 
	
	Eric Gutierrez flew out to Leonardo Molina to end the three-run eighth, but the RiverDogs going down 1-2-3 to Tyler Frohwirth&#x2019;s flawless ninth for Greensboro, the loss was already hung upon Trieglaff. </body>

The woman was hit by a Honda Accord while turning into an alley near the Top Of The Hill Restaurant &amp;amp; Brewery back bar. She was rushed to North Carolina Memorial Hospital and is expected to recover fully. The car&#x2019;s driver and passenger have been fully cooperative with the Chapel Hill Police Department&#x2019;s investigation into the incident.
	
	(POLITICS) &#x2014; Early voting for Orange County primary races began this past Saturday, April 21, for those citizens registered as Democrat, Libertarian or unaffiliated.

Early voting will continue through May 5.
	
	(GOVERNMENT) &#x2014; Former Hillsborough K-9 officer Talon, a 14-year-old German shepherd, has passed away at home, surrounded by friends and family. Talon had a successful career helping locate illegal guns and narcotics and tracking elderly dementia patients accidentally separated from their caretakers. He had become a bit of a local celebrity after being featured in an episode of Phoebe Judge&#x2019;s Durham-based nonfiction podcast, &#x201C;Criminal&#x201D;, which chronicled his human partner&#x2019;s adjustment when forced to retire in 2015 in the episode &#x201C;Officer Talon.&#x201D; &lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Durham&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;(LAW ENFORCEMENT) &#x2014; A Zebulon woman turned herself into authorities on Tuesday, April 24, in connection with a hit-and-run incident 10 days earlier that killed Cesar Leon Andrades-Pacheco.

She is currently being held in Durham County jail under a $20,000 bond.
	
	(TRAFFIC) &#x2014; Two children and one adult were injured on Monday, April 23, when an Amtrak passenger train hit a pickup truck near the intersection of Driver and Pettigrew Streets. The crash happened shortly before 6PM. The Dodge Ram pickup truck in question was located between the tracks&#x2019; crossing arms when it was struck. All three individuals in the truck were rushed to Duke hospital. No one on aboard the train was reported injured.
	
	(LAW ENFORCEMENT) &#x2014; Durham County Sheriff&#x2019;s Office investigators do not suspect foul play in the death of a three-year-old girl who was found drowned in a creek near her home. Lucy Kramer was found face down in the water by her father, Joseph Kramer, on April 9. The incident report released to the public indicated that Kramer put Lucy and her sister down for a nap so he could get some maintenance work done in his crawl space; when he emerged from under the house, Lucy was no longer inside the house. After discovery, she was taken to Duke Hospital, where she died. &lt;br&gt;

During his tenure, Morning Edition climbed in the ratings to eventually become the most-listened-to AM drive-time radio program in the country, a position it still holds. In 2009, he left the news desk to co-host the quiz show &#x201C;Wait Wait&#x2026; Don&#x2019;t Tell Me!&#x201D; with Peter Segal. His death was attributed to Alzheimer&#x2019;s complications. 
	
	(SPORTS) &#x2014; After four years on the job, Bill Peters resigned from his position as head coach of the National Hockey League&#x2019;s Carolina Hurricanes on Friday, April 20.

The other was charged with accessory after the fact and felony possession of stolen goods, and is currently being held on a $15,000 bond.
	
	(POLITICS) &#x2014; At their Wednesday, April 25 meeting the Chapel Hill Town Council passed a resolution to adopt the legislative agenda of the state General Assembly&#x2019;s 2018 regular session. The agenda includes support for two bills of local interest and one with statewide ramifications. The two local bills would 1) remove the legal requirement to post advertisements for public meetings in the newspaper, and 2) broaden the acceptable investment opportunities used to fund municipal retirement benefit packages. The state initiative would give general support to the League of Municipalities and North Carolina Metropolitan Mayors Coalition legislative programs. 
	
	(OBITUARY) &#x2014; Conservationist Richard Jenrette, who played an important role in preserving historic public spaces in Hillsborough and elsewhere, passed away this week at the age of 89. A graduate of UNC-Chapel Hill, Jenrette first became known to the public when his investment bank Donaldson, Lufkin &amp;amp; Jenrette became the first to go public on the New York Stock Exchange in 1970, kicking off a new era of sky-high Wall Street profits. In 1993, he founded the the not-for-profit Classical American Homes Preservation Trust, and one of the first pieces of property he donated to the trust was Ayr Mount plantation home in Orange County, which is a public educational site.

	(CRIME) &#x2014; Durham County sheriff&#x2019;s deputies arrested a 17-year-old in connection with a home invasion and homicide that occurred at 1908 Torredge Road at about 11:30 PM on Thursday, April 25. Stirling Clark, age 32, was found dead after a 911 call brought officers to the location. A witness told deputies that the suspect fled on foot, and the deputies were able to apprehend the alleged suspect shortly after. The teenager was charged with murder and larceny of a firearm. 
	
	(EDUCATION) &#x2014; During a press conference preceding the Durham Public Schools Board of Education meeting, a Durham Association of Educators spokesperson formally requested that the board cancel classes for May 16, when a planned demonstration at the General Assembly in Raleigh is scheduled. Over 800 teachers in the district have already requested time off for personal days on that date. The board voted against suspending school that day, though all the board members voiced support for the teachers, who are advocating for higher pay, smaller class sizes and better funding.
	
	(POLITICS) &#x2014; The Hillsborough town board gave permission to town manager Eric Peterson to release personal employment information about Durham County Sheriff candidate Clarence Birkhead this past Monday evening. Birkhead was Hillsborough&#x2019;s police chief from 2005 to 2010. This move was in response to public comments made by Birkhead and Peterson in regard to the accreditation status of Hillsborough&#x2019;s police department. State law does not allow information on government workers to be released without consent, unless "the release is essential to maintaining public confidence in the administration of city services or to maintaining the level and quality of city services." 
	
	(SCIENCE) &#x2014; A female red wolf at the Durham Museum of Life and Science gave birth to litter of three pups on April 21. The adorable trio consisted of two males and one female, and will be isolated from most visitors for the next few months. The pups are healthy, and will open their eyes approximately 10 days after birth. Red wolves are near extinction due to loss of habitat and aggressive predator control programs. There are fewer than 300 alive today.

    <title>Activist Who Threw Ink and Blood On Silent Sam Cuffed By UNC Police</title>
    <subhead>Civil War Memorial Is Focus Of Controversy and Politics</subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>CHAPEL HILL &#x2014; A breezy and otherwise tranquil Monday afternoon on the North Campus quad at the University of North Carolina was disrupted by the arrest of a graduate student and the temporary defacement of a prominent campus landmark with gallons of red ink mixed with her own blood.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Silent Sam, a statue commemorating University of North Carolina students who died fighting in the Civil War, has been a focal point for controversy and campus activism for many years, including large protests at the beginning of the 2017 fall semester.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;UNC Chancellor Carol Folt has been criticized for not wielding her position as the head of the nation&#x2019;s first public university to order the statue&#x2019;s removal. Folt has publicly deferred to Governor Roy Cooper and the North Carolina General Assembly. A state law permits the removal of campus monuments only if they pose an &#x201C;imminent threat&#x201D; to safety.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At McCorkle Place, the tree-shaded campus quad bordered by Franklin Street to the north, activity picked up at 2 PM as a few people set up signs around the statue. The signs proclaimed the racist nature of Silent Sam&#x2019;s existence on a diverse campus.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Maya Little, a doctoral candidate at UNC&#x2019;s history department and an organizer in the fight for Silent Sam&#x2019;s removal, approached the statue of a Confederate States of America infantryman facing north.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The red ink Little threw slathered the plaque depicting the scene described above. By noon Tuesday, the red mixture was removed and the statue, its plinth, and surrounding walk had been pressure-washed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Little approached the statue with two bottles of red ink mixed with (as reported to the Sundial by a fellow organizer) blood from a self-inflicted wound, and poured the bottles on the statue. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A UNC Police officer confronted Little and informed her that she was under arrest, then escorted her to a squad car while surrounded by Little&#x2019;s supporters, who chanted her name shouting, &#x201C;You are loved!&#x201D;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In anticipation of being taken into custody, Little released a written statement critical of Folt, which read in part: &#x201C;Chancellor Folt and the administrators are &#x2026; dedicated to silencing us. In her first two years, there was no state law against removing the statue. She has heard countless activists tell her the statue&#x2019;s presence dehumanizes and threatens people of color.&#x201D;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The statement concluded, &#x201C;You, Chancellor Folt &#x2014; and your donors, the students you recruit, the alumni you cater to &#x2014; will be forced to see it until every facet of white supremacy on this campus has been removed.&#x201D;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A campaign led by a coalition of students and faculty members who call for Silent Sam&#x2019;s immediate removal developed in the wake of the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia on August 11-12, 2017, where the removal of a statue of Confederate military commander Robert E. Lee led to large-scale protests and the death of activist Heather Heyer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Silent Sam was at the center of a tumultuous protest in the first week of the 2017 fall semester that drew a crowd of approximately 1,000 people calling for the statue&#x2019;s removal. The August 22 protest came in the wake of the violence in Charlottesville. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A Sundial reporter reached out by phone to UNC Police Department public information office Randy Young for comment but was directed by voicemail to the school&#x2019;s Office of Communications and Public Affairs. The office emailed the Piedmont Sundial the following statement.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#x201C;Shortly after 2 p.m. today (Mon., April 30), a woman from among a small group in McCorkle Place poured red paint on the Confederate Monument. A UNC Police officer took the individual, who will be charged with vandalism, into custody. UNC Facilities Services removed the paint from the monument.&#x201D; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While one protester gave a speech through a megaphone proclaiming UNC&#x2019;s obligation to condemn the values of the Confederacy and Jim Crow laws, Little stepped up to the statue, emptied the contents of the two bottles, which covered each side with a thick scarlet liquid.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#x201C;On the front of the monument, a brass plaque depicts a woman clad in classical dress, representing North Carolina, resting her hand on the shoulder of a seated student, convincing him to take up arms,&#x201D; reads a description of the plaque in the Commemorative Landscapes of North Carolina reference available through &lt;a href="docusouth.unc.info" target="_blank"&gt;DocuSouth,&lt;/a&gt; a digital archive presented by the University of North Carolina.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Shortly after Little&#x2019;s arrest, a group of workers sprayed the affected areas with a solvent and pressure-washed the red mixture away. Cleaning of the statue and its site continued Tuesday.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Samuel Finesurrey, who is also a UNC history doctoral candidate, was among the small circle of activists given prior notice of the action by Little. He told the Sundial, &#x201C;We don&#x2019;t quite understand why this university continues to support this statue&#x2026; It creates shame among this community.&#x201D; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Finesurrey said Silent Sam is just one symptom of &#x201C;a larger problem within [UNC] where you have buildings named after Klan members and former slave owners; we&#x2019;re trying to figure out what this university represents.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#x201C;This is about Carol Folt; she has failed this campus,&#x201D; said Finesurrey. &#x201C;She wants to contextualize the statue?&amp;nbsp; Now it&#x2019;s contextualized; that is what happened today.&#x201D; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alex Eaker, a sophomore at UNC, was present at the scene but does not consider himself to be active in the anti-Silent Sam camp. Eaker said he does find Little&#x2019;s protest to be laudable, however. &#x201C;I see it as a step forward for social justice. . . and I really just think it&#x2019;s a good thing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&#x201C;There have been a lot of protests about this since I&#x2019;ve been here, but this is the first time there&#x2019;s been an actual defacement,&#x201D; Eaker continued.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another onlooker, sophomore Alexandra Smith, spoke to the Sundial as she surveyed the aftermath. &#x201C;I think this is a sign that students and community members together are really fed up with the lack of response by the university,&#x201D; she said.&amp;nbsp; &#x201C;It&#x2019;s time to just have it removed from campus.&#x201D;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;UNC Police have not responded to inquiries regarding Little&#x2019;s bail status as of publication. Protestors had returned to Silent Sam by Tuesday afternoon, as campus workers continued to treat the statue with solvents.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</body>

    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>News and notes from the Triangle and Piedmont.
	
	&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Orange County&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
	
	(CRIME) &#x2014; As part of a vice sweep this weekend, the Orange County Sheriff&#x2019;s Office has charged 17 individuals with multiple counts related to the trafficking and distribution of methamphetamine, marijuana and cocaine in areas of Hillsborough and Mebane. As of May 1, deputies have 11 of the suspects in custody but are still seeking information that could lead to the arrests of Calvin Montez Whitted, Brandon Christopher Dodd, Joseph Philbert Frasier, Ronisha Montriece Whitted, Justin Allen Utsman and Laura Brooke Gallagher. Any tips from the public should be directed to Investigator B. K. Wilkerson at 919-245-2900.
	
	(COMMUNITY) &#x2014; The &#x201C;Southern heritage&#x201D;  organization Alamance County Taking Back Alamance County (ACTBAC) has hoisted a Confederate battle flag onto a 20-foot-high pole visible to drivers headed westbound on U.S. Highway 70. The flag is on private property at 1201 Cornelius Street in Hillsborough and measures 20 inches  by 20 inches. In a statement released on social media, ACTBAC stated, &#x201C;It's up, it's flying, it's on private property, legal permit, and we followed all rules and regulations." The Orange County Commissioners will be seeking public comment regarding changes to signage ordinances and the flag&#x2019;s future on May 15 in Chapel Hill. The Sundial covered the flag&#x2019;s permission to fly &lt;a href="https://piedmontsundial.com/calendar/calendar_main_article.php?theArticle=58" target="_blank"&gt;earlier&lt;/a&gt; this year.
	
	(DEVELOPMENT) &#x2014; The North Carolina Department of Transportation announced this week the temporary closure of Arthur Minnis Road at the intersection of Dodsons Crossroads in Hillsborough. Traffic will be blocked at the location in both directions from Monday, April 30 until Friday, May 4 at 4 PM. A detour has been established utilizing both Dodsons Crossroads and Dairyland Road. Workers will be replacing a defunct pipe.
	
	(SPORTS) &#x2014; The UNC-Chapel Hill women&#x2019;s tennis team defeated Duke for the ACC Championship title on Sunday, April 29, 4-2. Standout Tar Heel players included Makenna Jones, who won both her singles and doubles matches, and Alle Sanford who gave the Tar Heels their first lead of the match. UNC will play in the NCAA Regionals on May 11. 
	
	&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Durham&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
	
	(COMMUNITY) &#x2014; Workers&#x2019; rights groups and union organizers in Durham numbering in the dozens joined protesters around the world in celebrating International Workers Day on May 1 with a planned march beginning at the Police headquarters and proceeding down Pettigrew Street to the city jail. Traffic was halted by a police escort, and no major incidents occurred. May 1 has been the traditionally recognized labor holiday for most Western nations since the late 19th century. The United States has more associations for labor movements with Labor Day every September, while in 1958 President Dwight Eisenhower declared May 1 Law Day, for the sake of &#x201C;cultivation of the respect for law that is so vital to the democratic way of life.&#x201D;
	
	(COMMUNITY) &#x2014; The proposal to honor the life and work of civil rights leader Malcolm X that was scheduled for a vote by the Durham City Council, was removed from the agenda Monday evening. Durham Public Affairs Director Beverley Thompson told the press that, due to an administrative technicality, the item did not yet have proper authorization and was not allowed to proceed. The Sundial reached out to Mayor Steve Schewel by email but has not yet received a response.
	
	&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;State News&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
	
	(HEALTH) &#x2014; An extremely rare form of eye cancer known as ocular melanoma was independently detected  in 18 individuals, all of whom have connections to one of two small Southern towns: Auburn, Alabama or Huntersville, North Carolina. The epidemiological curiosity has confounded experts, as the condition&#x2019;s cause remains a medical mystery. Patients who received these diagnoses started a Facebook group and were contacted by 36 people connected to Auburn University who claim to have been stricken with other types of melanoma. </body>

	&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Orange County&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
	
	(CRIME) &#x2014; Chapel Hill police apprehended a third suspect on May 3 in connection with a series of vehicular break-ins stretching back to February.  The 36-year-old woman is currently being held on a $40,000 secured bond at the Orange County jail. Charges have been filed against  her and two men already in custody for allegedly targeting both locked and unlocked cars for theft. Police and town officials are encouraging residents to make sure that all vehicles are locked while unattended, and to secure all valuables indoors, if possible.
	
	(EDUCATION) &#x2014; The Chapel Hill-Carrboro School Board unanimously voted on May 3 to declare May 16 an optional teacher work day. The board&#x2019;s decision was in response to the large number of faculty members who had already made clear their intention to travel to Raleigh on that date and rally at the General Assembly in support of teacher pay raises. The Sundial spoke with Christen Campbell, a French teacher at Chapel Hill High School, who spoke at the meeting in favor the schedule change. When asked why she felt moved to comment, she responded, &#x201C;I came because I love what I do, and time and time again I&#x2019;ve been frustrated by the wages... I feel like they don&#x2019;t reflect the importance of the work that we do.&#x201D; 
	
	(HEALTH) &#x2014; The North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services released its latest numbers this past week on influenza-related deaths for the 2017-2018 season. A total of 378 lives were lost this past winter, making it significantly deadlier than the 2016-2017 season, when 218 people succumbed to the virus. State analysts claim that the majority of the deaths involved senior citizens and very young children, and experts are still encouraging people to get flu shots, despite the flu season&#x2019;s official March 31 end date. 
	
	(CRIME) &#x2014; Hillsborough police officers were involved in a high-speed chase Saturday morning, which culminated in one arrest, after responding to two separate burglaries in nearby neighborhoods. At 3 AM, officers were dispatched to Cornwallis Hills after a break-in was reported. While interviewing the homeowner, a second 911 call was received from the Gatemoore community only miles away, identifying a similar vehicle occupied by two individuals. Prior to police arriving at the second break-in, one suspect fired a flare gun at the homeowner and attempted to escape with his partner. Hillsborough PD and Orange County Sheriff&#x2019;s deputies tried to block them with squad cars but were forced to chase them down Churton Street. The suspects crashed their vehicle at an intersection only blocks away, and then attempted to flee on foot. Police have apprehended only one of the pair as of 2 PM on May 5. The name of the suspect still on the loose has not been made public.
	
	&lt;br&gt;
	
	&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Durham&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
	
	(NATURE) &#x2014; Durham Police caught the attention of some animal lovers on Twitter this Friday, May 4, after the department posted a snapshot of an officer stopping traffic to escort a jaywalking turtle from danger. The 7:40 AM photo got liked and retweeted throughout the morning. It was accompanied by the following statement: &#x201C;The DPD is in the business of promoting safety. We just hope this little guy looks both ways before he crosses next time.&#x201D;
	
	(POLITICS) &#x2014; Durham County Deputy Director of Elections George McCue announced on Friday that Sheriff candidate Clarence Birkhead turned his required campaign finance report four days late and will likely be fined $50 for each day past the deadline. The report indicates that Birkhead&#x2019;s campaign account started the year with close to $11,000 and then subsequently raised an additional $4,500. Birkhead also lent his campaign $5,000 of his personal funds. In contrast, his opponent, Mike Andrews, had about $5,700 in his account on January 1 and had raised $25,000 in contributions by April 21. 
	
	(CRIME) &#x2014; Durham police are currently investigating a fatal shooting that took place on the 400 block of Canal Street around 11:15 PM on Thursday, May 3. The victim was identified as 27-year-old Justin Royster; an additional wounded individual who was transported to the hospital with non-life-threatening injuries has not yet been named. Anyone with relevant information is encouraged to contact Investigator J. Mitchell at (919) 560-4440, ext. 29335. </body>

    <title>Carolina Votes! Election Notes and Primary Results</title>
    <subhead></subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>May 8, 2018 Primary Election Results
	
	Primary elections were held across the country Tuesday, with most voting sites on the east coast closing at 7:30 PM. Here are a few highlights from polling stations and campaign headquarters across the Triangle and surrounding counties.
	
	&#x25CF; Turnout for primaries usually is lower than in the general election. With this in mind, the Sundial spoke with a number of Orange County residents who cast their ballots at Carrboro Town Hall and asked why they made the effort to come out this Tuesday.
	
	Jan Gjestvang-Lucky, a customer engagement specialist at the SAS Institute in Cary, said, &#x201C;I feel like voting no matter what, whenever I have the opportunity is very important. It&#x2019;s my responsibility as a citizen, no matter which race or election it is,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;On the other hand, [the primary] is simply influencing, not determining, the main election. And, so it is maybe not as important as the general election, since I&#x2019;m not voting for a candidate for that specific office.&#x201D;
	
	Another Carrboro voter, Kathy Lucente, told the Sundial she feels that primaries tend to involve more difficult decisions. &#x201C;I feel like I need to examine the questions and the choices more closely, rather than just show up with a more basic understanding,&#x201D; she explained. She went on to say, &#x201C;Even if somebody&#x2019;s role is smaller, there are still choices, and I can still steer the role of government.&#x201D;
	
	&#x25CF;	Jillian Johnson, a member of the Durham City Council, used social media on Tuesday morning to call out Durham County Sheriff candidate Mike Andrews for endorsing a seemingly bigoted Facebook comment. 
	
	Johnson posted a screenshot taken from the &#x201C;Re-Elect Mike Andrews for Sheriff&#x201D; page. The screenshot showed a Facebook comment in which an Andrews supporter asked Durham citizens to turnout so &#x201C;city block voters[,] immigrants and minorities&#x201D; don&#x2019;t tip the scales of the election.&amp;nbsp;
	
	"Durham County you BETTER NOT apathetically sit home on your tails tommorrow [sic] ...as city block voters immigrants and minorities will FLOCK to the polls.", the comment read in part.
	
	The screenshot showed a response to that comment from the &#x201C;Re-Elect Mike Andrews for Sheriff&#x201D; page that said in reply to the comment's author, &#x201C;Amen Bobby!&#x201D;. The page is acknowledged by Andrews to be managed from an account registered to his campaign.
	
	Andrews later addressed the issue in an official statement, reading in part: &#x201C;Late last night one of my campaign page moderators posted an opinion on a comment that did not reflect my values, the values of my campaign, nor the values by which I run the Sheriff&#x2019;s Office, nor by which I have conducted my nearly 40 year law enforcement career. I do not agree with these comments in any form or fashion, but as the candidate, I accept full responsibility.&#x201D; 
	
	Andrews lost the election to challenger Clarence Birkhead.
	
	&#x25CF;	A polling station in Robeson county extended voting hours until 8:15 PM after an automobile accident in Lumberton momentarily delayed ballots from being cast at the Allentown Fire Department 
	
	&#x25CF;	Voting was briefly halted in Franklin County, just north of Raleigh, when the elementary school serving as the precinct polling place was locked down in response to a shooting nearbyNorth Carolina election officials declined to extend the site&#x2019;s hours past 7:30 PM, however, as state law stipulates that such an extension can be granted only in the event of shutdown lasting longer than 15 minutes.

    <body>&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN"&gt;News and notes from the Piedmont and Triangle.&lt;/span&gt;
	
	&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Orange County&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
	
	(Health) &#x2014; Parents with children attending Grady Brown Elementary school in Hillsborough received a letter from Orange County Health Director Quintana Stewart informing them that a student had been diagnosed with whooping cough, also known as pertussis.  The disease, the result of a bacterial infection, is considered highly contagious and manifests as flu-like symptoms, followed by a severe cough that can last up to 10 weeks. The nine-year-old student&#x2019;s infant sibling was reported by their parents to also be sick, and was confirmed by county health officials to also have the illness. Both children had previously been vaccinated, but inoculation for whooping cough is not considered a lifelong guarantee of immunity.
	
	(Culture) &#x2014; In a surprise twist, Chapel Hill dive bar and music venue The Cave will not be closing after all. The 45-year-old establishment was scheduled to shut its doors permanently, but once word of the closure got out in late April, an outpouring of community support was expressed through social media. Then on Monday, May 7, musician and former Cave bartender Melissa Swingle announced that a last-minute deal that would allow The Cave to remain open under its original name had been struck between herself and a partner and the new leaseholders . A grand re-opening party will be scheduled for the end of June; The  Cave&#x2019;s Facebook page will provide updates.
	
	(Development) &#x2014; UNC Chapel Hill Vice Chancellor for Financial Operations Jonathan Pruitt sent a message to Chapel Hill Mayor Pam Hemminger and Town Manager Roger Stancil on Tuesday May 8 informing them of the impending closure of the university-owned Horace Williams Airport. As per Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations, the small airport&#x2019;s single runway will be declared inactive on May 16, and plans to convert at least some of the space into a solar energy project will be implemented. The main reason cited by school officials for the closure is the potential threat air traffic poses to the nearby residential neighborhood. 
	
	&lt;br&gt;
	
	&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Durham&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
	
	(Community) &#x2014; Outgoing Durham County Sheriff Mike Andrews publicly rebuffed a request made by Latino civic organizations that his office no longer honor detainer agreements with the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE). At a May 6 public meeting organized by Durham Congregations, Associations &amp;amp; Neighborhoods (CAN) in anticipation of the upcoming primary election, Andrews told the crowd that refusing to cooperate with orders to hold undocumented individuals for 48 hours when asked to would expose more residents to possible deportation when ICE inevitably attempts to search for targets at their residences and places of work. Andrews&#x2019; primary opponent, Clarence Birkhead, who was also at the meeting, agreed to a policy of noncooperation. Birkhead went on to win the May 8 primary election. 
	
	(Community) &#x2014; The Durham-based -weekly newspaper Indy Week published an article on May 8 implicating Duke Vice President of Student Affairs Larry Moneta in the firing of two employees at campus coffee shop Joe Van Gogh. The story reported that Moneta was buying from the caf&#xE9;, where he was a regular customer, when a rap song he found offensive played on the sound system. Moneta asked that an employee turn off the music, which the employee did. After Moneta left, he allegedly called management to complain. The call resulted in the termination of baristas Britni Brown and Kevin Simmons. The day after the Indy Week&#x2019;s story ran, Moneta sent an email to multiple media outlets explaining his side of the story. He claimed that the decision to fire the workers was Joe Van Gogh&#x2019;s alone, and that he simply reported his experience.
	
	(Crime) &#x2014; A Durham man died after suffering multiple gunshot wounds on Sunday evening at approximately 6:30 PM. Police arrived at Stadium Drive near Duke street and found Carlos Jones clinging to life. He died after being transported to the hospital. A carjacking and fatal shooting took place on nearby Canal street only 30 minutes later, and authorities are looking for a connection. Friends and family held a vigil for Jones on Monday. Police have no suspects in custody as of this writing, but anyone with information is encouraged to contact Investigator M. Evans with the Durham Police at (919) 560-4440. 
	
	(Emergency) &#x2014; A Durham woman was rescued from a house fire after being trapped on the second story of her home at 8 Regan Court. Firefighters responded approximately five minutes after the woman called 911 and managed to reach her through the window, using a ladder. It took approximately 20 minutes to contain the blaze, and heavy damage to the roof and attic was reported. The cause of the fire is still under investigation. The woman was taken to Duke hospital and is being treated for shock and smoke inhalation.

	&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;State News&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
	
	(Emergency) &#x2014; A request made by North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper for federal disaster relief in the wake of a deadly tornado that struck Guilford and Rockingham Counties on April 20 was approved by President Donald Trump this week. Residents of those areas who believe that they may qualify for government assistance for property repairs, medical bills or other expenses may apply on the Federal Emergency Management Agency&#x2019;s website. In a &lt;a href="https://governor.nc.gov/news/gov-cooper-announces-aid-guilford-and-rockingham-residents-affected-tornado" target="_blank"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; posted on Cooper&#x2019;s website, Cooper stated that, for those unable to gain access to the internet, the state&#x2019;s opening disaster recovery centers will assist relief applicants in person. </body>

In a &lt;a href="https://apps.ncdot.gov/newsreleases/details.aspx?r=12329" target="_blank"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; posted on the NCDOT website, the bride does not meet &#x201C;the demands of the traffic using it and has reached the end of its life cycle.&#x201D;  The release went on to say, &#x201C;NCDOT reminds motorists to watch signs for construction information, stay alert and obey the posted speed limit.&#x201D;  The estimated date of completion is Friday, August 10.

Hillsborough Police responded to a break-in at 615 Hampton Pointe Boulevard at approximately 1 AM on Thursday, May 10.  Upon arrival, they found a smashed window, and a number guns and a quantity of  ammunition missing from the store.  The same location was previously broken into on April 4. The police have no suspects in custody, and it is not known if the two incidents are related.  Hillsborough Police are now working on the case in conjunction with the federal Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms. Anyone with information is encouraged to call Investigator Purvis at 919-296-9533.

After learning of the incident, in which a Duke administrator complained to cafe management when Dolph&#x2019;s song &#x201C;Get Paid&#x201D; popped up on a Spotify playlist, resulting in their swift termination, he flew the two to Miami, Florida and invited them to his concert.  Young Dolph told the crowd the money was to assist the two while they look for new jobs.  Joe Van Gogh has officially cut ties with Duke in the wake of the scandal.

In all of 2016, there were 854 marijuana-related arrests and citations, which fell  to 498 in 2017.  The numbers have been trending downward since at least 2013, when the community FADE (Fostering Alternatives to Drug Enforcement) Coalition made a formal recommendation that marijuana be considered among the least prioritized offenses.  Data shows that African Americans are disproportionately affected by these misdemeanor arrests, making up 78 percent of those charged in 2017.

The victim did not immediately report the incident to police, but waited until she returned to her Brooklyn home before contacting authorities.  The New York Police Department reached out to officials at RDU after being made aware of the situation.  The incident appears to have taken place within a five-minute time period shortly after the young woman and her family had arrived on a Delta flight.  Current information indicates that the male suspect was in the women&#x2019;s restroom before the victim entered.  The Sundial reached out to RDU Police but has received no response as of publication.

	(INVESTIGATIONS)&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="font-family: Quattrocento-Regular, OpenSans-Regular, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 22.6px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"&gt;&#x2014;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;U.S. Rep. Mark Meadows of North Carolina&#x2019;s 11th congressional district has launched a new counterpunch against the investigation led by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III. 
	
	Meadows announced Friday that he will request that the Government Accountability Office conduct a financial audit of Mueller&#x2019;s investigation into 2016 U.S. presidential election interference. 
	
	The Washington Examiner reports that, in a CSPAN interview set to air Sunday, Meadows will call upon Congress to audit Mueller&#x2019;s investigation, which has brought more than 18 indictments and five guilty pleas in matters related to the 2016 campaign, including several of President Donald Trump&#x2019;s campaign aides, former campaign manager Paul Manafort, and former National Security Advisor Mike Flynn.
	
	&#x201C;Americans deserve to know how and where the Mueller team is using their tax dollars &#x2014; and how much of the investigation is truly about &#x2018;collusion&#x2019; vs. political targeting,&#x201D; Meadows said via Twitter on Friday, May 11.
	
	Mueller, a former director of the FBI, was appointed to lead the investigation following Trump&#x2019;s firing of FBI director James Comey a year before. 
	
	The Washington Examiner published an opinion piece by Meadows on April 26 containing questions addressed to Comey, casting aspersions upon Comey&#x2019;s version of what happened before and after Trump fired him on May 9, 2017.
	
	&lt;br&gt;
	
	(SENATE HEARINGS) &#x2014; North Carolina Sen. Richard Burr presided over the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence hearings into acting CIA director Gina Haspel, whom President Trump has nominated to permanently head the agency following former director Mike Pompeo&#x2019;s move to Secretary of State.
	
	Chairman Burr threatened to clear the public galleries after a disruption by a protestor who was reported to be former CIA analyst Ray McGovern, who served in the agency from the Kennedy administration through that of George H.W. Bush, and later became an activist against the CIA&#x2019;s post-9/11 interrogation tactics. 
	
	The protestor shouted that a direct response was owed Sen. Ron Wyden, who asked Haspel if she had ever called for CIA waterboarding programs to be continued or expanded between 2005 and 2007.  
	
	The committee&#x2019;s vote on Haspel looked shaky after Wednesday&#x2019;s hearing, when Sen. John McCain (a victim of torture in Hanoi after his capture during the Vietnam War) who is not a committee member, said he would not support her nomination if it came to the Senate floor. 
	
	Haspel&#x2019;s chances of confirmation on the floor were bolstered on Friday when Democratic senator Joe Donnelly announced his support.
	
	&lt;br&gt;
	
	(JUSTICE DEPT) &#x2014; North Carolina&#x2019;s 11th district U.S. congressional representative, Mark Meadows, is engaged in a war of words with officials of the U.S. Justice Department. 
	
	Meadows and fellow Freedom Caucus Republicans have sought documents from the Justice Department, including 1.2 million pages related to special counsel Robert J. Mueller&#x2019;s investigation into Russian election interference.
	
	Meadows fired back after Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein scoffed after a draft of articles of impeachment were leaked to the media.
	
	&#x201C;They can&#x2019;t even resist leaking their own drafts,&#x201D; Rosenstein said in a jocose moment during questions at a Law Day forum at the Newseum in Washington. 
	
	&#x201C;I just don&#x2019;t have anything to say about documents like that, that no one has courage to put their name on,&#x201D; Rosenstein said.
	
	Addressing the public comment that has swirled around President Donald Trump&#x2019;s criticism of the probe, Rosenstein responded to a question about the separation of powers in the U.S. Constitution. 
	
	&#x201C;I can tell you there have been people that have been making threats privately and publicly against me for quite some time, and I think they should understand by now the Department of Justice is not going to be extorted, we&#x2019;re going to do what is required by the rule of law. And any threats that anybody makes are not going to affect the way we do our job.&#x201D;
	
	Meadows has become the public face of congressional Republicans who are dissatisfied with Mueller&#x2019;s investigation into election interference. The probe began as an FBI investigation but was moved under the purview of a special counsel after the firing of James Comey as FBI director
	
	Rosenstein was appointed to his position by Trump. He oversees the Mueller investigation following the recusal of Attorney General Jefferson Sessions, whose conflicting statements about his activity during the 2016 Trump campaign came under harsh congressional questioning. 
	
	After Rosenstein&#x2019;s statement, Meadows fired back on social media, saying on Twitter, "If he believes being asked to do his job is 'extortion,' then Rod Rosenstein should step aside and allow us to find a new Deputy Attorney General &#x2014; preferably one who is interested in transparency."
	
	The 11th Congressional District covers the western part of North Carolina, running from Cherokee County to Caldwell County, covering 16 counties overall and a bit of Buncombe County.
	
	Meadows, first elected in 2012, won his GOP primary on May 8. He will face Democratic primary winner Philip Price in the November general election.

	A hailstorm crossed the eastern Triangle on Thursday, May 10. Fierce winds downed trees and damaged homes in north Durham, and power outages were reported across Durham and Franklin counties.
	
	The microburst caused evening skies over Chapel Hill and Carrboro to turn a deep orange, but a short dose of heavy rain was all that hit the downtown areas of the western Triangle. Video showed marble-sized hailstones falling in north Durham, and hailstones that fell in the region Thursday were reported to be more than an inch in diameter.
	
	Data supplied by Duke Progress Energy shows 300 power outages across its service area on Thursday, with more than 11,000 customers affected. Figures by county were not immediately available, but outages spiked by a factor of five between 4PM and 8PM Thursday, when the storm crossed over Durham and Franklin counties. 
	
	By Sunday, energy maps available online at &lt;a href="" target="_blank"&gt;https://www.duke-energy.com/outages/current-outages&lt;/a&gt; showed only  a handful of outages in the Triangle.</body>

	(CRIME) &#x2014; On Saturday, May 12, Durham police arrested 33-year-old woman  in connection with the death of her husband, who died on March 31. Bollock was found dead after a 911 call dispatched officers to 300 Umstead Street. Authorities initially believed the death to be result of a heart attack, but following the county medical examiner&#x2019;s requisite autopsy, the cause of death was changed to murder. Police have not released any information indicating a possible motive, or what physical evidence might link her to the murder. She is currently being held in the Durham County jail and was denied bail at her arraignment.

    <title>Sundial Lens: Conflicted View of South&#x2019;s Past Mixes 'Blood and Ink'</title>
    <subhead></subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>&lt;i&gt;In the 21st century, North Carolina towns are at a reckoning with their Civil War&#x2013;era namesakes and the American legacy of racial bigotry.&lt;/i&gt;
	
	CHAPEL HILL &#x2014; More than a century before Maya Little splashed it with a mixture of her blood and gallons of red ink, the statue of the Confederate soldier known as Silent Sam was dedicated where it still stands at McCorkle Place, on the north quad of the University of North Carolina.
	
	Garbed in the uniform of a Confederate infantryman and cast without a cartridge box for ammunition, the statue is dedicated &#x201C;to the sons of the university who entered the war of 1861&#x2013;1865 in answer to the call of their country,&#x201D; whose &#x201C;lives taught the lesson of their great commander that duty is the sublimest word in the English language.&#x201D; 
	
	Words spoken that day in 1913 have etched themselves into the statue&#x2019;s divisive legacy. The dedication speech was delivered by civic father and Confederate veteran Julian Shakespeare Carr, namesake for Chapel Hill&#x2019;s neighboring of town of Carrboro. 
	
	The dark side of Carr&#x2019;s legacy includes an open and enthusiastic support for the Ku Klux Klan, a public endorsement of the municipal coup known today as the Wilmington Massacre of 1898 and the particularly disturbing speech he gave at the unveiling of Silent Sam in 1913. 
	
	In the dedication speech, Carr invoked the &#x201C;Lost Cause,&#x201D; praising what he viewed as the chivalrous ideals of the Confederacy, stating that Southern soldiers &#x201C;saved the very life of the Anglo Saxon race in the South&#x2026;and to-day as a consequence the purest strain of the Anglo Saxon is to be found in the 13 Southern States." 
	
	He went on to nostalgically and vividly relate an incident in which he personally assaulted an African-American woman in the streets of Chapel Hill.
	
	Not a hundred yards from the statue, Carr told the audience at the dedication, &#x201C;I horse-whipped a negro wench until her skirts hung in shreds, because upon the streets of this quiet village she had publicly insulted and maligned a Southern lady. . .&#x201D; He referred to this brutal event as his &#x201C;pleasing duty.&#x201D;
	
	Flash forward a hundred years. In Charlottesville, Virginia, the removal of a statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee triggers large protests and counterprotests. Anti-racist protestor Heather Heyer is killed by a car driving into a crowd. National and regional attention turns to the South&#x2019;s past tainted by segregation and slavery, and demonstrations in several states push a reckoning on public memorialization of the Lost Cause.
	
	Days after Heyer&#x2019;s death, a group of protestors in downtown Durham pulled down a memorial to Confederate soldiers killed during the Civil War.
	
	After the protest in Durham, vigils sprang up to guard Confederate statues in nearby Pittsboro and Graham, county seats with monuments standing north of their courthouses. A bouquet of flowers left on the plinth at the Alamance County Courthouse in Graham bore the card of &#x201C;Identity Evropa,&#x201D; a group of self-described &#x201C;white identitarians&#x201D; whose headquarters is in California, and whom the Southern Poverty Law Center has identified as a hate group. This followed a rally in support of the Durham  statue, which was erected in 1914.
	
	As national conversation has stirred around the public display of Confederate monuments, some have asked whether removing statues is going far enough. Others fear that removing monuments and names from buildings would be akin to whitewashing the past.
	
	The Town of Carrboro was known as West End when it was first settled in 1882, and as Venable after its incorporation. The town adopted its current name in 1913 to honor Carr, a local mill industrialist. However, documentation of his hateful bigotry &#x2014;  and aforementioned admitted beating of a black woman &#x2014; has caused the Carrboro Board of Alderman to now consider erecting a &#x201C;truth plaque&#x201D; to educate the public on the town&#x2019;s namesake&#x2019;s hurtful history.  
	
	Carr attended the University of North Carolina before serving in the Confederacy&#x2019;s Third North Carolina Cavalry during the Civil War. After the war&#x2019;s end, Carr become the very picture of a Gilded Age industrialist. His early business ventures were primarily tobacco-related and, only a few years after the war, he gained a partnership in Durham tobacco manufacturing company W. T. Blackwell &amp;amp; Co. 
	
	The profits Carr earned there enabled him to purchase the Alberta Cotton Mill in 1909. As it grew, the mill quickly became the center of commerce and employment for Carrboro; in some ways the building remains such, having been converted to the downtown shopping and office complex now called Carr Mill Mall.
	
	Julian Carr expanded his financial interests in the Carrboro area during the years following his purchase of the mill. It was during this period that Carr is credited with providing the infrastructure that enabled the downtown to first establish electric power.
	
	His philanthropic efforts were another boost to his status. Paradoxically, Carr gave money to local African-American schools, African-American-owned business initiatives, and the construction the Hayti Heritage Center building in the heart of one of Durham&#x2019;s oldest black neighborhoods.
	
	His financial and civic involvement with the town, combined with his status as UNC alumnus, Confederate veteran  and member of a pedigreed North Carolina family, were enough to award him the honor of town namesake.
	
	Knowing this history, Board of Aldermen member Jacquelyn Gist proposed at last week&#x2019;s regular meeting the &#x201C;truth plaque&#x201D;, an effort by the town to contextualize the problematic nature of its name and history by publicly acknowledging Julian Carr&#x2019;s flaws.
	
	Gist, who spoke to the Sundial by phone, said that part of her inspiration came from a trip she took to Fredericksburg, Virginia, where, at a preserved historical home, she found a display commenting on not only the white family who owned it, but also on the lives of &#x201C;black slaves who were forced to live and work there... I just thought that was really cool.&#x201D; 
	
	Gist went on to say that actually naming the town something less offensive was a nonstarter. &#x201C;We really can&#x2019;t change our name, and there are a lot of logistical and financial reasons why that would be difficult.&#x201D; Some of those reasons include the fees involved in formally altering a town charter, and the daunting prospect of &#x201C;everyone changing everything they have with a Carrboro address on it.&#x201D;
	
	But the potential plaque already has some harsh critics, namely activist Maya Little, a UNC doctoral candidate in history, who stepped into the national spotlight in late April when she vandalized the Silent Sam statue with red ink and blood. 
	
	&#x201C;The problem with plaques is they ground racism and white supremacy in 1913 [the year Silent Sam was erected and Carrboro was named] or any other bygone time, allowing the plaque makers to represent our current times as racism free,&#x201D; Little told the Sundial via email. 
	
	Silent Sam has been a flashpoint of controversy on campus for decades. It was defaced in July, 2015 with the words &#x201C;KKK&#x201D; and &#x201C;murderer&#x201D; and later that summer with a spray-painted reference to Sandra Bland, whose arrest and death in a Texas jail that year inflamed anger over the way Americans of color are treated during interactions with law enforcement and the penal system. During the first week of the 2017 fall semester, approximately 1,000 people rallied at the site, chanting for the statue&#x2019;s removal and swarming around officers when they arrested two protestors and removed them in a police van. There was no violence between demonstrators and police. 
	
	Little has been active in the movement pressuring the university to remove Silent Sam. Her experience has caused her to question the efficacy of a history lesson when attempting to address the grievances around institutional racism. &#x201C;I have stood at Silent Sam almost every day peacefully handing out information to passersby and have been threatened and called racial slurs,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;Providing historical information about Silent Sam did not shield me from racial hostility because as long as Silent Sam stands, racists feel emboldened and affirmed by the statue.&#x201D; 
	
	According to Little, simply removing Silent Sam is no longer enough. &#x201C;Frankly, UNC has not earned the right to remove Silent Sam until they address a myriad of other issues with institutional racism,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;The exploitation of black athletes for university coffers despite the very low retainment of these students, the inability to retain black faculty and grad student workers...[and] the creation of a history task force that refuses to incorporate activist voices or address continuing acts of racism at UNC&#x201D; are only a few of the issues to be addressed, she said. 
	
	&#x201C;In addition to removing Silent Sam and also the names of slave owners from buildings, UNC must reckon with and combat its contemporary racist institutions and campus culture.&#x201D; 
	
	As for the future of Silent Sam, uncertainty remains. UNC Chancellor Carol Folt has come under heavy criticism for her handling of the tensions. The Sundial reached out to UNC by email for a statement and received the following response:
	
	&#x201C;The University&#x2019;s position is the same as it has been &#x2014; Chancellor Folt has said on the record repeatedly that she would move the monument if she could, but that she is prevented from doing so by state law.&#x201D;
	
	Barbara Foushee, another Carrboro Board of Aldermen member, told the Sundial over the phone, &#x201C;I wish [Chancellor Folt] had been more vocal in her support for the removal of the statue&#x2026; Although I&#x2019;m sure it is a very precarious position to be in.&#x201D;
	
	When asked by the Sundial if the board expected any pushback with regard to the truth plaque initiative, Foushee said, &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t really anticipate any resistance to it, and I don&#x2019;t know where it would be coming from.&#x201D; She added, &#x201C;Carrboro being the Carrboro that it is, I&#x2019;d be really surprised.&#x201D;  
	
	In 2015, the campus building once known as Saunders Hall &#x2014; named for Klan leader, UNC graduate and prominent trustee William Saunders &#x2014; was renamed Carolina Hall after students and faculty members successfully pressured the administration. However, the Board of Trustees instated a 16-year freeze on renaming other university buildings in that same meeting.
	
	As for the Carrboro plaque, the town is currently researching placement and design options with assistance from the Carolina Women&#x2019;s Center&#x2019;s Moxie Project, which pairs UNC undergraduates with activist groups for special projects. 
	
	&#x201C;We&#x2019;re  not just going to have a bunch of white people design the plaque,&#x201D; Gist noted. The plan, she said, is to &#x201C;work closely with African-American community.&#x201D;</body>

    <title>Raleigh March For Educators Draws Thousands</title>
    <subhead>North Carolinians Call For Teacher Pay and Classroom Funding</subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>&#xD;

		&#xD;
			RALEIGH&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="color: rgb(84, 84, 84); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"&gt;&#x2014;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Despite scattered thunderstorms and heat in excess of 90 degrees, a tide of teachers, students, and education supporters flooded  the streets of Raleigh on May 16 to demand competitive teacher pay and greater per-pupil funding for public schools in North Carolina.
	
	&#x201C;The March for Students and Rally for Respect&#x201D;, was first proposed months ago by the North Carolina Association of Educators to promote more funding for classrooms, teachers, and public school facilities across the state.
	
	Governor Roy Cooper addressed an afternoon assembly at Bicentennial Plaza, promising to support teachers and place state money &#x201C;where our trust is.&#x201D;
	
	Marchers gathered at 9:30AM in front of the NCAE headquarters at 700 S. Salisbury Street.  Most of those in attendance were wearing red t-shirts and carrying an array of creatively rendered protest placards. 
	
	By 10AM, busloads of marchers had been dropped off nearby, and the crowd swelled to its peak numbers.  Estimates vary, but between 19,000 and 30,000 people are thought to have attended, which makes it the largest political demonstration organized by educators in the history of North Carolina.  
	
	North Carolina, which had the 10th highest GDP among states in 2017 (according to the U.S. Department of Commerce) ranks 37th in teacher pay, according to the U.S. Department of Education&#x2019;s National Center for Education Statistics.
	
	Among states, North Carolina ranks 43rd in statewide education funding.
	
	The march proceeded up Salisbury and Fayetteville streets and ended in front of the legislative building, where state senators and house members were returning to full session.  Up and down the major thoroughfares, storefronts and office buildings opened their doors to marchers, offering bathrooms, water and air conditioning to anyone needing a respite from the throngs and humidity.  
	
	The sea of red shirts, denim and khakis made a vivid sight flowing through the North Carolina Museum of History on Edenton Street, which opened its exhibits for free to show support for the marchers.
	
	Some of the public school employees who made the trek to Raleigh from their school districts were obliged to use one (or two, depending on distance traveled) of their allotted paid vacation days in lieu of their absence from work.  Forty-two school boards statewide voted to change their academic calendars to make Wednesday an optional teacher work day so as to not penalize teachers who chose to get involved.  These included Triangle-area school boards in Orange, Durham, Alamance and Wake counties.
	
	Once the march reached the General Assembly building, attendees spent the afternoon petitioning individual lawmakers face-to-face in hopes of building a coalition of &#x201C;pro-education&#x201D; politicians who might introduce bills addressing their key concerns.
	
	Those concerns include raising teacher pay and per-student spending to meet national averages, and the inclusion of $1.9 billion school construction bond on an upcoming election ballot, according to the NCAE website.
	
	Issues of teacher pay and school funding united many marchers. North Carolina teachers made $49,837 on average in 2016-2017 school year, the National Center for Education Statistics reported. That is approximately $9,000 below the national average of $58,950. 
	
	These issues were personal for many marchers. Ann Abernathy, an elementary school teacher from Wilmington, carried a sign reading &#x201C;Flatlined at 25&#x201D;, accompanied by an EKG readout signifying that North Carolina teachers are &#x201C;dead on arrival&#x201D;.  
	
	The design was a direct reference to a state policy limiting raises for teachers who have hit the seniority threshold.  &#x201C;I have not had a raise in years,&#x201D; said Abernathy.  &#x201C;I&#x2019;ve taught 32 years and I can&#x2019;t even afford to retire....some of the teachers who have only taught for ten years just got a sixteen percent raise, and I don&#x2019;t mind that, but they forget about the teachers with more experience.&#x201D;
	
	Theresa Menz, a high school teacher from Chapel Hill, told the Sundial that all of the hardships facing public school faculty in the state are a result of the General Assembly&#x2019;s refusal to provide schools adequate funding .  &#x201C;We can&#x2019;t retain teachers because of the salaries,&#x201D; she said.  &#x201C;And the per-pupil funding is really a big deal.  It involves everything from online textbooks to art supplies.&#x201D;
	
	North Carolina&#x2019;s teachers have reached into their own pockets to purchase materials and books for their classrooms, a consequence of local districts squeezed of state funding that scrimp on classroom supplies.
	
	When asked if she was optimistic about what the march might accomplish, Menz said, &#x201C;It&#x2019;s gonna send a message to parents...their kids were out of school today. Why?  Because their kids&#x2019; teachers were upset and making a statement.  And so, we&#x2019;re teaching them to resist apathy.&#x201D;  
	
	&#x201C;We&#x2019;re teaching young people how to take a stand and how to protest,&#x201D; she continued. &#x201C;And that&#x2019;s happening all over the country for lots of reasons.  I think there&#x2019;s a lot of momentum, and it feels really good.  Yes, I am very optimistic.&#x201D;
	
	Hannah Escala, a high school senior who plans to major in education in college, said she was motivated to attend the rally out of respect for the faculty teaching her at Rolesville High School.  &#x201C;I really just want to support my teachers and create a better future for our children.  I feel like [teachers] don&#x2019;t have enough money to allow their kids to do the best that they can.&#x201D;
	
	Escala also stated that she sees her peers suffering as a result of the budget allocation issue.  &#x201C;There have been great opportunities, and I did have a good experience, but I know that others were falling short, and the lack of funding isn&#x2019;t helping that.&#x201D;         
	
	Later in the afternoon, before a spurt of heavy rain dispersed the crowds, a second rally was held in Bicentennial Plaza, where marchers were addressed by Governor Cooper. 
	
	Cooper spoke in favor of a freeze on planned tax cuts, and implored the North Carolina General Assembly to consider granting more money to the North Carolina Department of Education.  
	
	"We trust you, our teachers," an energetic Cooper told the crowd. "And we need to put our money where our trust is." &#xD;

    <body>News and notes from the Piedmont and Triangle.
	
	&lt;b&gt;Orange County &lt;/b&gt;
	
	(CRIME) &#x2014; A man who was shot in Chapel Hill on Thursday, May 17 was pronounced dead at UNC Hospitals the following day. Police initially responded to a call reporting shots fired in or near the J building at Camelot Village Apartments on Estes Drive.  Upon arriving, they found 52-year-old Mark David Stiles in critical condition and rushed him to the emergency room.  No suspects have been taken into custody, and the Chapel Hill Police department said the shooting was more than likely &#x201C;an isolated incident and [we] do not believe there is an ongoing threat to the community.&#x201D;  The incident is currently being investigated as a homicide; anyone with information is encouraged to call Crime Stoppers at 919-942-7515.
	
	(HEALTH) &#x2014; A study published by the UNC Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center surveyed approximately 2,700 young adults to determine whether or not bright-colored packaging and artificial flavorings of cigar and cigarillo products mitigate the effects of the health warnings required to be printed those products.  In 2009, the Food and Drug Administration banned the use of flavorings (except menthol) in cigarettes, but those regulations did not apply to other forms of smokable tobacco.  The survey results found that cigarillos with pictorial or written warning labels were not rated lower in terms of taste and scent than those without warnings. The study concluded with the following recommendation: "In addition to a ban on flavor descriptors, and their accompanying product flavoring, enacting stricter regulations on imagery, such as plain packaging regulations that might eliminate colors on cigarillo packaging, are warranted and might reduce cigarillo use."  
	
	(DEVELOPMENT) &#x2014; The town of Chapel Hill unveiled two new charging stations for electric passenger vehicles last week, bringing the total number of such service locations to six.   The new stations are located at the Homestead Aquatic Center off Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard.  All of the stations currently owned and operated by the town are officially classified as Level 2 chargers that use 240 volts of A/C power and can fully charge an electric car battery in four to six hours, making them considerably more efficient than using a household outlet (Level 1).  Both of the new stations were paid for with a $10,000 grant from Duke Energy.  
	
	&lt;br&gt;
	
	&lt;b&gt;Durham &lt;/b&gt;
	
	(POLITICS) &#x2014; In a statement released Friday to announce his write-in candidacy for Durham County Sheriff, Major Paul Martin wrote that Durham has descended into &#x201C;anarchy and criminality&#x201D;, and that &#x201C;left wing Jim Crow now prevails.&#x201D; Martin has been employed by the sheriff&#x2019;s department for the last 17 years, and prior to that he spent two decades with the Durham Police Department. His statement asked voters to recognize the increasing polarization of American political and cultural life, and to not believe the hype behind Durham&#x2019;s reputation for openness and inclusivity.   He also accused left-wing activists of &#x201C;consciously creating an atmosphere where hardened criminals are considered victims,&#x201D; and that the &#x201C;radicals pushing this agenda do not live in vulnerable neighborhoods.&#x201D;  Martin needs a petition signed by one hundred registered voters in the county in order to qualify as a write-in candidate.
	
	       
	
	(CRIME) &#x2014; The United States Marshals Service arrested two men last week at an address on Snow Crest Trail in connection with the murder of 34-year-old Jerome Bryant Jackson.  Jackson was found dead in the street on the 1000 block of Moreland Avenue at 8AM on April 3, and both suspects had evaded capture until they were tracked down by the Marshals&#x2019; Joint Fugitive task force on Wednesday, May 16.  The men, both in their mid-twenties, are being held without out bond at Durham County Jail.   
	
	(CRIME) &#x2014; Police were forced to evacuate a section of a neighborhood near Horton after officers were drawn into a standoff with a man barricaded in his apartment.  The incident began when the suspect was met at his Chalk Level Road home by a bail bondsman serving a felony warrant.  The episode lasted until approximately 4:40 PM, when the man peacefully surrendered.  It is unknown as of publication whether the man was armed. 
	
	&lt;br&gt;
	
	&lt;b&gt;State News&lt;/b&gt;
	
	(OBITUARY) &#x2014; North Carolina governor Roy Cooper ordered all flags on state-owned buildings to be flown at half-mast this past Tuesday to honor the life of Chief Wilbert Lee Ammons. A World War II veteran and formerly the oldest sitting chief within the Coharie Indian Tribe, Lee passed away on May 11, 2018.  He served for over 30 years as the head pastor of Mt. Sinai Holiness Church in Buck Head, and for twenty years as the leader of a group of churches known as the Bible Free Will Holiness Conference. The Board of Directors of United Tribes of North Carolina named him Indian Elder of the Year in 2008. Ammons spent many years working for Lundy&#x2019;s Packing Co.   
	
	(SPORTS) &#x2014; Billionaire hedge fund manager and philanthropist David Tepper has finalized a deal to purchase the Carolina Panthers for $2.2 billion.  That pricetag sets the record for an NFL team to be sold and makes the Panthers&#x2019; sale one of the most expensive sports deals ever. Tepper was raised in a working-class section of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. After graduating from the University of Pittsburgh he made a name for himself on Wall Street by stringing together a series of successful high-risk investments in the midst of the 2008 recession.  His current net worth is estimated at $11 billion.  Tepper has owned a small share of the Pittsburgh Steelers since 2009, and will sell his stake in that AFC North Division team to own the NFC South Division Panthers.
	
	&lt;br&gt;
	
	&lt;b&gt;Transportation&lt;/b&gt;
	
	(DEPARTURE) &#x2014; The Horace Williams airport shut down its flight tower this past week, closing a chapter in the area&#x2019;s aviation history and leaving Chapel Hill bereft of one of the region&#x2019;s few public use airports.
	
	The airport will be turned into a field of solar cells, say University of North Carolina leaders. The university has sought designs for the solar project, estimated to cost $1.7 million in a design solicitation posted on the UNC Facilities website.
	
	The airport&#x2019;s demise was preordained as early as 2006, when its land was included in the footprint for an ambitious development plan being promoted by UNC before the financial crisis of 2008. 
	
	At least 250 acres of Carolina North Forest, adjacent to the now-defunct airport, is apportioned for grading and development into Carolina North, a proposed satellite campus for UNC. 
	
	The airport&#x2019;s history dates to 1933, after land for the airport was gifted to the university by Henry Horace Williams, the philosophy professor for whom the airport was named.
	
	During World War II, Ted Williams of the Boston Red Sox trained to be a naval airman there, and barnstormed with his fellow recruits on a team called the Chapel Hill Cloudbusters. 
	
	&#x201C;This would represent a significant loss to the local community and to aviation history,&#x201D; Stephen Schoenberger wrote in the News &amp;amp; Observer on March 2. The Asheville resident has written letters to other media outlets, highlighting the airport&#x2019;s importance for emergency access to UNC Hospitals.
	
	&#x201C;Both local and non-local doctors are continually arriving and departing the medical center via air,&#x201D; wrote Schoenberger, arguing for the airport&#x2019;s redevelopment, instead of closure.
	
	Located within Chapel Hill&#x2019;s business district, Horace Williams was a conduit for businessmen participating in conferences on campus and successful alumni returning for UNC sporting events. The airport also served amateur pilots and professional small-craft aviators.</body>

	(COMMUNITY) &#x2014; Free Spirit Freedom, a cultural initiative within the Hillsborough Arts Council, spent Sunday, May 20, celebrating the 50th anniversary of local public school desegregation with community members at the Farmers Market Pavilion in downtown Hillsborough. The date marks the graduation of the final class of Orange County&#x2019;s historically black high school, known as Central High School. The school was permanently shut down shortly afterward. Festivities included a full gospel choir and an alumnae basketball game; the event also served as the official reunion for Central&#x2019;s class of 1968. 
	
	(CRIME) &#x2014; The Chapel Hill Police Department has made an arrest in connection with the May 17 shooting of Mark David Stiles at Camelot Village Apartments. Stiles died at UNC Hospital the following day. The police report that the incident was the consequence of a personal dispute between Stiles and the suspect, and that there is no danger to the greater community. The Sundial reached out to the department&#x2019;s communications officer Ran Northam to inquire as to the nature of the dispute, but he declined to comment. The suspect is currently being held at Orange County Jail on a $1.25 million secured bond and will likely be charged with homicide.
	
	(OBITUARY) &#x2014; Chapel Hill, restauranteur, soul food traditionalist and community figure Mildred Council passed away at the age of 89 on Monday, May 20, leaving behind a host of happy memories and a beloved style of cooking. Council was best known as the founder and proprietor of Mama Dip&#x2019;s Kitchen on Rosemary Street, which she opened in 1976 with only $64 dollars in the bank to purchase initial ingredients for opening day. 
	
	Only a decade later in 1985, legendary New York Times food critic Craig Claiborne visited the eatery on a tour of the South and wrote that &#x201C;it was a pleasure to come upon Dip's Country Kitchen, a genuine, no-frills restaurant [of soul food] in Chapel Hill.&#x201D; That reference helped turn a local secret into a nationally known destination for comfort meals. Some scholars of traditional foodways argue that Council played a huge part in the recognition of Southern cuisine as a respectable culinary endeavor across the country. 
	
	Council was more than a successful entrepreneur and chef; she also took a strong interest in civic engagement and outreach, helping to start the annual Chapel Hill Community Dinner. Open to the public, the Community Dinner is now a staple event each year in town. 
	
	Funeral services will be held on Sunday, May 27 at Chapel Hill Bible Church.
	
	&lt;br&gt;
	
	&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Durham&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
	
	(SCI/TECH) &#x2014; The State of North Carolina has made a $3 million incentive package grant to biotech company AveXis to open up a clinical research facility in Durham, which is expected to bring 200 new jobs to the area. The company, which currently specializes in the developing treatments for spinal muscular atrophy, turned down a similar offer from the State of Illinois in favor of the Bull City. AveXis will be attempting to lease an abandoned warehouse in the Research Tri-Center South building to create a testing and production lab space and offices. The company is getting ready to submit its new drug, AVXS-101, to the Food and Drug Administration for vetting and approval.      
	
	(EMERGENCY) &#x2014; Two lucky people and one lucky feline managed to escape unharmed after the attic above their one-story home burst into flames on Monday, May 21. Firefighters were dispatched at 3 PM to 5106 Gable Ridge Drive and had the flames under control within 15 minutes of arrival. The house sustained heavy smoke and fire damage, but will again be habitable once repairs are complete. 
	
	(GOVERNMENT) &#x2014; A proposal to allow Durham residents to take part in some decisions regarding municipal budget allocation was affirmed by a 5-2 vote by the city council this Monday, May 21. This is Durham&#x2019;s first attempt to implement a model known in policy circles as &#x201C;participatory budgeting,&#x201D;  and its approval came on the heels of an intense debate between council members as to the exact funding figures. The final number agreed upon, $2.4 million, will be divided evenly among the city&#x2019;s three wards; residents will be able to vote only for projects within their own wards. The initiative should be fully operational by this time next year. The two council members who voted against the proposed figure were Mayor Steve Schewel and council member Mark-Anthony Middleton.

	(POLITICS) &#x2013; Thirteen demonstrators were taken into custody by General Assembly Police officers on Monday, May 21, following a rally organized by the national Poor People&#x2019;s Campaign in capital cities across the country. According to the Associated Press, 100 protestors broke off from the rally, entered the legislative building and fanned out in smaller groups to confront individual Republican lawmakers. The protestors engaged in loud sloganeering and made policy demands, including living wage laws and universal health care. Officials ordered the crowds to leave the premises after multiple noise complaints were lodged. The demonstrators who refused to comply were escorted out in handcuffs and booked at a nearby holding facility. </body>

    <title>Rosa's Home: Safe Zone from ICE in House of Worship</title>
    <subhead></subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>&#xD;
		&#xD;
		&#xD;
			&#xD;
		CHAPEL HILL &#x2014; &#x201C;Sanctuary is the call of the gospel to us, the way Christ calls us to love our neighbors as ourselves," said Pastor Isaac Villegas. &#x201C;The Tora also calls us to welcome foreigners, strangers and immigrants.&#x201D;
	
	Villegas is the pastor of Chapel Hill Mennonite Fellowship. The congregation is housed on the same grounds as the Church of Reconciliation on North Elliot Road in Chapel Hill, where Rosa Del Carmen Ortez-Cruz, 37, now lives.
	
	A resident of North Carolina for 11 years, Ortez-Cruz lives in the Church of Reconciliation under sanctuary from ICE agents who would seek to return her to Honduras, the homeland she fled out of fear of an ex-husband and his gang connections. 
	
	 &#x201C;When I tried to leave, he said, 'If I can't have you, nobody can,' as he stabbed me repeatedly in my abdomen, my intestines,&#x201D; Ortez-Cruz said as she put down her jewelry-making tools and lifted her shirt. She showed scars all over her stomach. She describes her ex-husband&#x2019;s weapon as a large &#x201C;long knife.&#x201D;
	
	She pulled up her sleeves and showed another large scar on her arm. &#x201C;When he got me on the ground, he tried to stab me in the chest, and [in the struggle] got my arm instead,&#x201D; Ortez-Cruz said, lifting her severely scarred arm.&#xD;
		&#xD;
		&lt;span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;serif&amp;quot;;&#xD;
mso-fareast-font-family:&amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:&#xD;
EN-US;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA"&gt;Rosa Del Carmen Ortez-Cruz&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;
		&#xD;
					&lt;br&gt;
	
	Surrounded by her different crafts projects, Ortez-Cruz tells her story.
	
	Ortez-Cruz was born in Tegucigalpa, Honduras, in Central America. She and her six siblings were supported by their mother, a single parent who worked at a shrimp packing company with no other support.
	
	Rosa later found what she thought was love, married and had a beautiful baby boy. Then the abuse began. She barely survived the worst, the attack with the long knife, and spent a month in the hospital in San Pedro Sula, Honduras. 
	
	In 2002, she fled to the United States while her young son stayed with her mother. The child came to the United States later with Ortez-Cruz's sister. They lived in Washington D.C., then Virginia before moving to Greensboro in 2007.
	
	&#x201C;I had a friend who lived in North Carolina, and they said that it was easier to live here with the cost of living,&#x201D; said Ortez-Cruz. 
	
	In America, she found stability and safety. She now has four children, a husband and a job at a water filter plant in Greensboro.
	
	All of that changed in March, when she was marked for deportation. For Rosa, a visit from Homeland Security's ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) agents could mean saying goodbye to her whole life  &#x2014; her job, her new country, her home, her husband and even her children  &#x2014; and a one-way trip back to a country where a man who threatened to kill her resides. 
	
	While it may be easy for some Americans may take their country for granted, for Roza Ortez-Cruz it is a world teetering on the edge. Now, what stands in the way of the demolition of Ortez-Cruz's life are Americans who believe their God commands them to protect Rosa and others like her whose lives hang in the balance. 
	
	Hope Shand is a volunteer host with Church of the Reconciliation. She stands guard in the volunteers&#x2019; makeshift quarters within the church, protecting Rosa and providing company for her.
	
	Volunteers take four-hour shifts during the day, and others take eight-hour shifts during the night. Still others donate money and time in other ways. Ortez-Cruz makes a list of her needs, and volunteers provide supplies. She spends a lot of her time in the kitchen cooking. She also knits and makes jewelry. The churches have converted office space into a bedroom, and also put aside a bath and closet for he ruse. Rosa may roam the grounds, but must never leave them.
	
	Sanctuary is granted only on the church property. Her new husband and all four children, ages 19, 13, 9 and 7, still live in Greensboro, where they are in school. They come to visit when they can. Rosa did not want her family members named in order to help protect them.
	
	&#x201C;It is hard,&#x201D; said Ortez-Cruz. &#x201C;I miss my job, and I miss my family, my children,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;When they come to see me, it is very difficult to see them leave.
	
	She has run out of jewelry-making supplies and, other than volunteers, she does not get many visitors.
	
	&#x201C;I have a lawyer, and my case is being appealed,&#x201D; Ortez-Cruz added as she straightened her crochet work.
	
	The appeal could take anywhere from nine months to a year.
	
	The two churches notified ICE when Rosa first arrived for sanctuary, but have yet to get a response.
	
	&#x201C;We are invoking the historic principle of sanctuary,&#x201D; said Pastor Mark Davidson of the Church of Reconciliation. &#x201C;It goes back to the ancient Hebrews, in the times of the Old Testament, when they offered a safe zone in their cities. It was used in the Middle Ages by the Christian churches as a refuge during times of war and violence, and grows out of the Biblical mandate to welcome a stranger or practice radical hospitality.&#x201D;
	
	There have been more than 100 volunteers coordinated among 12 churches to make this effort run smoothly. Rosa's husband's family is also helping. For four children to be suddenly without a mother leaves a gaping need.
	
	&#x201C;Catholics, Episcopalians, Baptists, Unitarian Universalists, Quakers, Mennonites and others not affiliated with any churches are reaching out and helping,&#x201D; said Davidson.
	
	They see their willingness to open their hearts and worship space to her as part of their mission of following Christ. 
	
	&#x201C;I am very grateful for all the support, and I hope the attention helps my case,&#x201D; Ortez-Cruz continued, &#x201C;but I have no idea how long I will be here.  But I hope to God it won&#x2019;t be too long.&#x201D;	&#xD;

    <title>JAWS Fest Attacks! Chapel Hill Midway Fest Sat. &amp;amp; Sun.</title>
    <subhead></subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>&#xD;
		&#xD;
			CHAPEL HILL &#x2014; JAWS Fest, the Triangle's most shark-infested block party, stands for what is unique and awesome about the Chapel Hill&#x2013;Carrboro culture's mania for creative recreation.
	
	The fanfest for Steven Spielberg's 1975 thriller takes place Saturday and Sunday in downtown Chapel Hill along Midway, the block of buildings on Graham Street housing the Baxter barcade, Rumors Boutique, Sid's Haircuts, the Beer Study and Al's Burger Shack. Around the corner on Franklin Street are International Pizza III and Local 506. All of those businesses, plus Tin Cup Joe, the Belltree and others, are participants in JAWS Fest activities this weekend.&lt;div class="calendarArticlePhotoBox" id="CalendarArticlePhotoBox-87"&gt;&#xD;
		&#xD;
		&#xD;
		&#xD;
		&#xD;
					The shark looked fake? So what &#x2014; whether you go in for the classic pacing of the original or the goofy camp of its sequels, the Jaws mystique is rooted in common fears of big water, open and dark and deep, and terror of getting eaten alive from below the surface. 
	
	JAWS Fest originated at the Station, the Carrboro bar where a signboard commemorated the U.S.S. Indianapolis (whose grisly tale of shark attack is recounted by Robert Shaw&#x2019;s character Quint in &#x201C;Jaws&#x201D;).
	
	When JAWS Fest&#x2019;s founders opened The Baxter barcade, they brought the festival with them. The big gallery of pinball and arcade machines will be filled to the gills with fans of &#x201C;Jaws,&#x201D; fans of sharks, and fans of shark-movie street festivals. 
	
	&lt;b&gt;Block party featuring: &lt;/b&gt;
	
	&#xF0A7;	Food truck rodeo
	
	&#xF0A7;	Haircuts for charity
	
	&#xF0A7;	Beer tent

    <title>Piedmont News Blotter: Sunday, May 27</title>
    <subhead></subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>News and notes from the Piedmont and Triangle.
	
	&lt;b&gt;Orange County&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
	
	(COMMUNITY) &#x2014; In an effort lower the volume of nonemergency 911 calls in Orange County, the town of Chapel Hill has developed and launched a new smart phone app called Chapel Hill Connect, which will allow residents to reach out to officials when aid is wanted but an emergency call may be inappropriate. Examples of situations where the app may be of use include small infrastructure damage or minor ordinance violations. The app will feature an interface with the ability for a user to snap a picture of the report&#x2019;s subject as well as leave a comment for explanation. The app will also route information into new work order software that is currently used by town staff to communicate internally about similar issues.
	
	(GOVERNMENT) &#x2014; The Town of Carrboro is moving an initiative to begin charging an annual fee to property owners for a stormwater fund to deal with issues related to water runoff. Fees would be imposed per lot and would be scaled to the size of the lot. The policy would favor denser development, since multiple dwelling units on a single lot would receive the same fee as a single dwelling. Fees will start at $75 and scale up to more than $1,300. Town Manager David Andrews said the fee would be imposed yearly. Heavy rain in June 2013 caused flood damage to homes in the Rocky Brook neighborhood and other Carrboro homes near Toms Creek, also Camelot Village in Chapel Hill (along Bolin Creek). This history is front in the minds of municipal leaders. At a May 15 meeting of the Carrboro Board of Aldermen, Alderman Jackie Gist expressed her wish to enact the fees rather than getting mired in the details. 
	
	(RESCUE) &#x2014; Savannah Jastram and Norman Picard, two Chapel Hill residents, saved a child from drowning at the pool located at University Gardens Apartments on Hillsborough Street. The two were in the vicinity around 9:15 PM on Saturday, May 19 when they saw one of two girls at the edge of the pool go under. After pulling her from the water, Jastram began standard CPR procedures, which revived the unconscious youngster. Emergency services responded soon afterward. Picard and Jastram both received challenge coins from the town, an official honor normally reserved for law enforcement, EMT and fire rescue employees.
	
	(HEALTH) &#x2014; An official at the Orange County Health Department sent a letter to parents last Wednesday, May 23 informing them that a possible case of chicken pox was reported at East Chapel Hill High School. The student believed to be infected had attended a concert recital just days before at which pupils from Phillips Middle School were also present, so the letter may also apply to parents whose Phillips students may have been exposed.  The letter read in part, "If your child develops any symptoms  of chicken pox, contact your child&#x2019;s pediatrician or local health department to discuss his care. Please call ahead if you are planning to visit any type of healthcare facility.&#x201D; Chicken pox is an extremely contagious disease caused by an infection of the varicella zoster virus that manifests as a rash of small blisters. Patients risk infecting others for a period of time from two days prior to the appearance of symptoms until all the blisters scab over. 
	
	(ENTERTAINMENT) &#x2014; Chapel Hill&#x2019;s oldest rock club and landmark for touring bands of all styles, The Cave, will reopen soon under new owners Autumn Spencer and Melissa Swingle. The &#x201C;Cavern Tavern&#x201D; announced its closure at the end of April; a raucous weekend of celebration featuring a lineup of many bands attended the club&#x2019;s closing in the early morning hours of May 1. But a few day later, an agreement was struck between the club&#x2019;s owners, its landlord and Swingle and Spencer, two former employees under previous ownership. There will be a celebration on June 29.
	
	&lt;br&gt;
	
	&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Durham&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
	
	(IMMIGRATION) &#x2014; Jos&#xE9; Hernandez, a window installer living in Durham, was turned over to the federal department of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) by the Durham County Sheriff&#x2019;s Office on Saturday, May 26, which raised some questions about what procedures the county should follow when dealing with ICE. Hernandez was scheduled to make an appearance before Superior Court Judge Orlando Hudson on Tuesday. Judge Hudson told the media that an attorney for the Sheriff&#x2019;s office had promised that Hernandez would be present for the hearing. Hernandez was arrested while conducting routine business at his bank when a detective asked to see his ID, whereupon a warrant was discovered relating to a past DWI arrest. Hernandez came to the United States as teenager fleeing violence and claims fears for his life if deported. 
	
	(CRIME) &#x2014; Police are investigating a shooting that occurred on Friday, May 25 at the intersection of South Alston Avenue and East Main Street. Officers arrived at the scene shortly past midnight after being dispatched to a traffic accident in the area. Police found the adult male victim in the driver&#x2019;s seat of his car with an apparent gunshot wound to the back and was brought by emergency responders to Duke Hospital to be treated for his injuries. The passengers in both cars reported minor injuries. Police have not arrested any suspects, and anyone with information is encouraged to call Crime Stoppers at (919) 683-1200.
	
	(CRIME) &#x2014; Durham police announced on Thursday, May 24, that they have arrested four more people in connection with the ambush and murder of restaurant owner Hong Zheng. All four suspects are male and over eighteen years-old. The motive for the attack is still unclear, although one of the suspects had been placed on probation only 10 days prior to the arrest for a 2017 armed robbery. Zheng and his wife, Shirley Chan, were attacked on April 15 in their driveway after closing their restaurant for the evening and returning home. Chan returned fire on the five individuals who ambushed them. The fifth individual was apprehended last month. All five have been charged with first-degree murder, attempted first-degree murder, attempted robbery with a dangerous weapon, attempted first-degree burglary and several counts of discharging a weapon into an occupied vehicle or residence.&amp;nbsp;
	
	&lt;br&gt;
	
	&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;State News&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
	
	(RELIGION) &#x2014; Rev. William Barber, founder of the Moral Mondays demonstrations in Raleigh, will officiate a service next Sunday at the National Cathedral in Washington, D.C. Barber has been arrested outside the North Carolina General Assembly alongside other activists for refusing to disperse, an act of civil disobedience during protests led by Rev. Barber over North Carolina&#x2019;s refusal of Medicaid payments, low teacher pay, and other policies seen to deprive the underprivileged. 
	
	On Saturday, Barber made an appearance on MSNBC beside Bishop Michael Bruce Curry, the American pastor who officiated the British royal wedding on May 19. Barber spoke to host Joy Reid on the intersection of faith and activism, citing the Book of Luke, chapter 4, verse 18: &#x201C;Jesus started out his public ministry, saying, &#x2018;The spirit of the Lord is upon me to speak ministry to the poor.&#x2019;&#x201D; He continued, &#x201C;Thirty-seven million people without health care; what would Jesus say and what would Jesus do&#x2014;in the Congress, not just as a matter of personal charity?&#x201D; Further, &#x201C;seventy-three million women and children in poverty, [and] many thousands of people dying without health care in the wealthiest country in the world. What would Jesus say? What would Jesus do?... He would be talking about justice, he would be talking about poverty, challenging the system.&#x201D;
	
	Rev. Barber will administer the Holy Eucharist on June 3, the second Sunday after Pentecost. The service will be accompanied by sacred music from the Washington National Cathedral Choir.</body>

    <title>Florida State Wins ACC Baseball Title</title>
    <subhead></subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>DURHAM &#x2014; Florida State won the 2018 ACC Baseball Championship at Durham Bulls Athletic Park on Sunday, beating Louisville 11-8 to capture the title for the second year in a row. It was the Seminoles&#x2019; eighth conference crown overall.  
	
	Devin Mann, Josh Stowers and Zach Britton each homered for Louisville, but that was not enough to stave off Florida State&#x2019;s offense. Both teams&#x2019; starting pitchers were knocked out of the game early, but Florida State&#x2019;s bats outpunched the Cardinals overall.  
	
	Florida State, seeded third, captured last year&#x2019;s championship by beating UNC in Louisville, where the 2017 tournament was moved as part of the ACC&#x2019;s boycott of the state of North Carolina over its &#x201C;House Bill 2&#x201D; legislation regulating restroom use and restraining municipalities from creating local antidiscrimination laws. 
	
	The tournament returned to downtown Durham in 2018 thanks to a compromise in the North Carolina General Assembly palatable to ACC administrators, and the 12-team tournament opened on Tuesday, May 22.
	
	Under new tournament rules, 12 teams played in four pools of three teams each. Each team played the other two teams in its pool once during pool play. A team that won both its games during pool play would advance to a semifinal playoff. In a pool where each team split its games with a win and a loss, the team with the highest pretournament seedings would have advanced, but each of the four teams who advanced from pool play in 2018 was a two-game winner. The respective pool winners were Pittsburgh, Louisville, Clemson and Florida State.
	
	Florida State went 16-13 in the ACC regular season, finishing fourth in the league&#x2019;s Atlantic division. 
	
	Coming into the tournament, the storyline was the strong performances of the &#x201C;big three&#x201D; regional teams &#x2014; Duke, N.C. State and North Carolina.
	
	But North Carolina lost its first game of the tournament to Pittsburgh, assuring Pitt (which had not made the 2017 tournament) top place in its pool &#x2014; and shattering UNC&#x2019;s hopes for the championship. 
	
	Neither Duke nor N.C. State, each team having won 40 games during the regular season, made it out of their respective pools into the semifinals. Duke lost to Louisville and NC State lost both its games, to Florida State and Virginia.
	
	Clemson was bounced by Louisville on Saturday after the Tiger bats had decimated their opponents in pool play, scoring 28 runs in two games.
	
	Pittsburgh, which did not make the tournament in 2017, eliminated Georgia Tech and North Carolina before going down to Louisville on Saturday, 2-5.
	
	Florida State has won the league championships in 1995, 1997, 2002, 2004, 2010, 2015, 2017 and 2018.</body>

    <body>News and notes from the Piedmont and Triangle.
	
	&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Orange County&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
	
	(DEVELOPMENT) &#x2014; North Carolina&#x2019;s annual state government budget was released to the media on Monday, May 28, and language within it has some worried that the planned Chapel Hill-to-Durham light rail project could be put on hold indefinitely as the General Assembly waits for a promise of matching funds from the federal government. The approximately 18-mile high-speed passenger transportation system has been in the works for years, and is expected to cost a total $2.4 billion. Orange and Durham counties have already spent a combined $88 million in preparation for the federal application. The budget language requires written confirmation that all non-state funds be &#x201C;secured&#x201D; before the General Assembly releases its $200 million contribution. The budget will be voted on this week and is expected to pass both state houses.
	
	&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
	
	&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Durham&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
	
	(CRIME) &#x2014; Durham defense attorney Allyn Sharp&#x2019;s motion on behalf of her client, Hunter Anderson, to lower the cost of his bail based on constitutional concerns, has been held in abeyance by judge Orlando Hudson. This means no decision will be made at the present time, and it&#x2019;s possible no action may be taken until the new District Attorney takes office after the November election. Anderson, who was arrested for statutory rape almost two years ago, is required to post bond at half a million dollars to be released. Sharp argued that this is in direct violation of the eighth amendment, which prohibits not only &#x201C;cruel and unusual punishment&#x201D; but also &#x201C;excessive bail,&#x201D; and that Anderson&#x2019;s low wealth requires that the court reassess the amount.
	
	(CRIME) &#x2014; Dashawn Devonte was found dead his Durham County jail cell at 8 AM on May 29. Devonte, 23, had no known major health problems, and was being held on $750,000 bond for charges of fleeing to elude arrest, hit and run (property damage), two counts of robbery with a dangerous weapon, felony conspiracy and two counts of failure to appear in court. Devonte is the seventh person to die in the jail since 2013. James Staton Jr, Terry Lee, Dennis McMurray, Raphael Bennett, Matthew McCain and Uniece Fennell also died in custody.The issue of mortality rates in the county facility was a key talking point in the recent primary race for sheriff in which Clarence Birkhead defeated incumbent Mike Andrews to secure the Democratic Party nomination. 
	
	(DUKE) &#x2014; The Duke Blue Devils basketball team will be taking a week-long exhibition trip to Canada on August 19. The tour will include three games in Montreal and Toronto, but the scores will not count toward rankings and the tour is not considered part of the regular season. The NCAA allows each athletic program to make use of school funds for an international trip once every four years. The team had previously been scheduled to travel to the Dominican Republic in August, but an unexpected knee surgery that Coach Mike Krzyzewski was required to undergo precluded that from happening.&amp;nbsp;
	
	&lt;br&gt;
	
	&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Raleigh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
	
	(CRIME) &#x2014; A Raleigh woman faces criminal charges of driving while intoxicated (DWI) after an investigation into an incident in which she crashed her car into the home of one of her neighbors at 1:30 AM Tuesday. The vehicle penetrated a brick sidewall, causing extensive structural damage. While multiple residents were present in the single-family dwelling on Westpine Court at the time of the accident, no injuries were reported.&amp;nbsp;

	&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;State News&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
	
	(WEATHER) &#x2014; Governor Roy Cooper issued a statement on Monday, May 29, warning North Carolina residents that the week ahead will consist of heavy rains and electrical storms as subtropical storm Alberto makes its way up from Florida, where it made landfall Monday evening. Cooper made it clear that conditions will be ripe for flooding and landslides. The statement also gave public acknowledgment to the deaths of two television news employees from Greenville, South Carolina, Mike McCormick and Aaron Smeltzer, who were killed near Tryon, North Carolina when high-speed winds blew a tree onto their vehicle. Cooper wrote that &#x201C;we mourn with their families, friends and colleagues.&#x201D;

One planned topic is how to effectively broach the issue of alcohol with adolescents. Members of law enforcement and mental health professions will be on hand to speak and to field questions from the audience. The American Automobile Association (AAA) issued a report this month indicating that the 100 days lasting from Memorial Day to Labor Day are the deadliest time of the year for teenagers behind the wheel.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;(EDUCATION) &#x2014; America&#x2019;s go-to periodical for academic rankings, U.S. News &amp;amp; World Report, has named all three high schools in the Chapel Hill&#x2013;Carrboro City Schools (CHCCS) district as the top traditional institutions of secondary learning in North Carolina. East Chapel Hill High took the number one spot, followed by Chapel Hill High and then Carrboro High. Nontraditional public high schools interrupted the overall public school rankings, with the Early College at Guilford being first-place in state and School of Inquiry and Life Sciences in Asheville superseding Carrboro High School for third place. Graduation rates, AP classes, enrollment attrition and diversity are all factored into the final decision, though the precise process for judgment is kept under wraps.&amp;nbsp;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;(ARTS) &#x2014; The Smithsonian&#x2019;s National Portrait Gallery has sent one of its unique exhibitions on a short tour of the United States, and Chapel Hill&#x2019;s Ackland Art Museum is the only host in the Southeast. The pieces on display, collectively called &#x201C;The Outwin: American Portraiture Today,&#x201D; are the selected winners of the 2016 Outwin Boochever Portrait Competition, named for beloved docent Virginia Outwin Boochever and seeking to &#x201C;elevate and expand the parameters of the genre.&#x201D; Aficionados of the fine arts will be able to view the entire collection, which opened on June 1, from until August 26. More information is available on the Ackland website.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;(CRIME) &#x2013; An Orange County jury returned a guilty verdict on May 31 against Chapel Hill resident Ramone Alston for first-degree murder in the shooting death of 14-month old Maleah Williams. Williams was struck by a stray bullet on Christmas day of 2015 as one of those present at an all-ages outdoor gathering when shots were fired at a man whom the district attorney says the two defendants had a grudge against. Alston&#x2019;s defense attorney did not dispute his client&#x2019;s presence near the scene, but argued that Williams&#x2019; was shot by the second man, Pierre Je Bron Moore, who has also been charged with the homicide (Moore&#x2019;s trial date has not been scheduled yet). Lawyers for the prosecution did not seek the death penalty. Judge Rebecca Holt will issue the sentence.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Durham&lt;/b&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;(CRIME) &#x2014; Durham Police Department detectives are investigating the suspicious death of William Bishop, a wealthy developer with business ties to the Tampa, Florida, area. Bishop&#x2019;s 16-year-old son made the 911 call, telling the dispatcher that he found his father unresponsive with a dog leash wrapped around his neck and the family dog still attached to the other end. Police confiscated relevant electronic devices from the home to be forensically examined, including the younger Bishop&#x2019;s smartphone. One of the multiple search warrants executed on the Bishop residence mentioned a &#x201C;possible motive&#x201D; within the phone&#x2019;s content. The same warrant also cited unspecified concerns from the medical examiner suggesting foul play.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;(CRIME) &#x2014; The Harris Teeter grocery store off Horton Road in north Durham has shortened its operating hours to 6 AM through 11 PM following a four-man armed robbery on Thursday, May 31 at approximately 3 AM. Victims described being forced to the ground at gunpoint and made to surrender their wallets and phones. The thieves then took off with what cash they could take from the registers and a few packs of cigarettes. Corporate spokesperson Dana Robinson issued a statement that read, in part, &#x201C;Our Asset Protection team is fully cooperating with the Durham Police Department and will do whatever it can to assist in the investigation.&#x201D;&amp;nbsp; Anyone with information is encouraged to call Crime Stoppers at (919) 683-1200.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Triad&lt;/b&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;(GOVERNMENT) &#x2014; Neurosurgeon and Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Ben Carson spent a good portion of Friday, June 1 touring neighborhoods in Greensboro and participating in a round-table discussion with the district&#x2019;s U.S. House Representative Ted Budd. Carson also made an appearance at a community housing conference hosted by UNC-Greensboro, where he was able to speak face-to-face with low-income housing experts and city planners. The Secretary&#x2019;s visit was scheduled for the first day of National Healthy Homes Month, an outreach initiative organized by HUD with a goal &#x201C;to greatly boost awareness and understanding of what federal and local resources are available to make a difference in the lives of all residents, regardless of where they live.&#x201D;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;(NATURE) &#x2014; The Forsyth County Department of Animal Control has informed the public of the third black bear sighting&amp;nbsp; this year in the Winston-Salem area, one spotted near a movie theater in the city limits on Thursday, May 31. State wildlife officials told the Associated Press that such sightings are not considered uncommon this time of year, especially in Forsyth and Guilford counties, and that the bears present very little danger if left alone. The U.S. National Parks Service website lays out the correct protocol if a person accidentally finds themselves in a worst-case scenario: &#x201C;If you are attacked by a black bear, DO NOT PLAY DEAD [unlike with grizzly and brown bears]. Try to escape to a secure place such as a car or building. If escape is not possible, try to &#xFB01;ght back using any object available. Concentrate your kicks and blows on the bear's face and muzzle.&#x201D; Bear attacks in North Carolina are extremely rare. &lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;br&gt;</body>

    <title>Memoriam: On June 6, Robert F. Kennedy's Words Rise From A "Day of Affirmation"</title>
    <subhead></subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>Two years to the day of his death, Robert F. Kennedy delivered the "Day of Affirmation" speech on June 6, 1966 in Cape Town, South Africa.
	
	After the death of John Fitzgerald Kennedy, the president's younger brother was elected U.S. Senator for New York. In 1966, he went to South Africa to accept invitation of the National Union of South African Students (NUSAS) to speak at the University of Cape Town.
	
	In his speech there Kennedy referenced the troubled history of race relations in South Africa and the United States, the tenets of participatory democracy, including the freedom of speech, and the social values of equality before the law and equality of opportunity.
	
	"Hand in hand with freedom of speech goes the power to be heard, to share in the decisions of government which shape men's lives," Kennedy told the assembly.
	
	Two years later, on June 6, 1968, Robert Kennedy was assassinated at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles, following his victory speech for the California primary in the race for the Democratic Party presidential nomination.
	
	&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;National Union of South African Students "Day of Affirmation"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
	
	University of Cape Town
	
	June 6, 1966
	
	&lt;i&gt;I came here because of my deep interest and affection for a land settled by the Dutch in the mid-seventeenth century, then taken over by the British, and at last independent; a land in which the native inhabitants were at first subdued, but relations with whom remain a problem to this day; a land which defined itself on a hostile frontier; a land which has tamed rich natural resources through the energetic application of modern technology; a land which once imported slaves, and now must struggle to wipe out the last traces of that former bondage. I refer, of course, to the United States of America.&lt;/i&gt;
	
	&lt;i&gt;But I am glad to come here to South Africa. I am already enjoying my visit. I am making an effort to meet and exchange views with people from all walks of life, and all segments of South African opinion, including those who represent the views of the government. Today I am glad to meet with the National Union of South African Students. For a decade, NUSAS has stood and worked for the principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights &#x2014; principles which embody the collective hopes of men of good will all around the world.&lt;/i&gt;
	
	&lt;i&gt;Your work, at home and in international student affairs, has brought great credit to yourselves and to your country. I know the National Student Association in the United States feels a particularly close relationship to NUSAS. And I wish to thank especially Mr. Ian Robertson, who first extended this invitation on behalf of NUSAS, for his kindness to me. It's too bad he can't be with us today.&lt;/i&gt;
	
	&lt;i&gt;This is a Day of Affirmation, a celebration of liberty. We stand here in the name of freedom. At the heart of that Western freedom and democracy is the belief that the individual man, the child of God, is the touchstone of value, and all society, groups, the state, exist for his benefit. Therefore the enlargement of liberty for individual human beings must be the supreme goal and the abiding practice of any Western society.&lt;/i&gt;
	
	&lt;i&gt;The first element of this individual liberty is the freedom of speech: the right to express and communicate ideas, to set oneself apart from the dumb beasts of field and forest; to recall governments to their duties and obligations; above all, the right to affirm one's membership and allegiance to the body politic &#x2014; to society &#x2014; to the men with whom we share our land, our heritage, and our children's future.&lt;/i&gt;
	
	&lt;i&gt;Hand in hand with freedom of speech goes the power to be heard, to share in the decisions of government which shape men's lives. Everything that makes man's life worthwhile &#x2014; family, work, education, a place to rear one's children and a place to rest one's head &#x2014; all this depends on decisions of government; all can be swept away by a government which does not heed the demands of its people. Therefore, the essential humanity of men can be protected and preserved only where government must answer &#x2014; not just to the wealthy, not just to those of a particular religion, or a particular race, but to all its people.&lt;/i&gt;
	
	&lt;i&gt;And even government by the consent of the governed, as in our own Constitution, must be limited in its power to act against its people; so that there may be no interference with the right to worship, or with the security of the home; no arbitrary imposition of pains or penalties by officials high or low; no restrictions on the freedom of men to seek education or work or opportunity of any kind, so that each man may become all he is capable of becoming.&lt;/i&gt;
	
	&lt;i&gt;These are the sacred rights of Western society. These were the essential differences between us and Nazi Germany, as they were between Athens and Persia.&lt;/i&gt;
	
	&lt;i&gt;They are the essence of our differences with communism today. I am unalterably opposed to communism because it exalts the state over the individual and the family, and because of the lack of freedom of speech, of protest, of religion, and of the press, which is the characteristic of totalitarian states. The way of opposition to communism is not to imitate its dictatorship, but to enlarge individual freedom, in our own countries and all over the globe. There are those in every land who would label as Communist every threat to their privilege. But as I have seen on my travels in all sections of the world, reform is not communism. And the denial of freedom, in whatever name, only strengthens the very communism it claims to oppose.&lt;/i&gt;
	
	&lt;i&gt;Many nations have set forth their own definitions and declarations of these principles. And there have often been wide and tragic gaps between promise and performance, ideal and reality. Yet the great ideals have constantly recalled us to our duties. And &#x2014; with painful slowness &#x2014; we have extended and enlarged the meaning and the practice of freedom for all our people.&lt;/i&gt;
	
	&lt;i&gt;For two centuries, my own country has struggled to overcome the self-imposed handicap of prejudice and discrimination based on nationality, social class, or race-discrimination profoundly repugnant to the theory and command of our Constitution. Even as my father grew up in Boston, signs told him that No Irish Need Apply. Two generations later President Kennedy became the first Catholic to head the nation; but how many men of ability had, before 1961, been denied the opportunity to contribute to the nation's progress because they were Catholic, or of Irish extraction? How many sons of Italian or Jewish or Polish parents slumbered in slums &#x2014; untaught, unlearned, their potential lost forever to the nation and human race? Even today, what price will we pay before we have assured full opportunity to millions of Negro Americans?&lt;/i&gt;
	
	&lt;i&gt;In the last five years we have done more to assure equality to our Negro citizens, and to help the deprived both white and black, than in the hundred years before. But much more remains to be done.&lt;/i&gt;
	
	&lt;i&gt;For there are millions of Negroes untrained for the simplest of jobs, and thousands every day denied their full equal rights under the law; and the violence of the disinherited, the insulted and injured, looms over the streets of Harlem and Watts and South Side Chicago.&lt;/i&gt;
	
	&lt;i&gt;But a Negro American trains as an astronaut, one of mankind's first explorers into outer space; another is the chief barrister of the United States government, and dozens sit on the benches of court; and another, Dr. Martin Luther King, is the second man of African descent to win the Nobel Peace Prize for his nonviolent efforts for social justice between races.&lt;/i&gt;
	
	&lt;i&gt;We have passed laws prohibiting discrimination in education, in employment, in housing, but these laws alone cannot overcome the heritage of centuries &#x2014; of broken families and stunted children, and poverty and degradation and pain.&lt;/i&gt;
	
	&lt;i&gt;So the road toward equality of freedom is not easy, and great cost and danger march alongside us. We are committed to peaceful and nonviolent change, and that is important for all to understand though all change is unsettling. Still, even in the turbulence of protest and struggle is greater hope for the future, as men learn to claim and achieve for themselves the rights formerly petitioned from others.&lt;/i&gt;
	
	&lt;i&gt;And most important of all, all the panoply of government power has been committed to the goal of equality before the law, as we are now committing ourselves to the achievement of equal opportunity in fact.&lt;/i&gt;
	
	&lt;i&gt;We must recognize the full human equality of all of our people before God, before the law, and in the councils of government. We must do this, not because it is economically advantageous, although it is; not because of the laws of God command it, although they do; not because people in other lands wish it so. We must do it for the single and fundamental reason that it is the right thing to do.&lt;/i&gt;
	
	&lt;i&gt;We recognize that there are problems and obstacles before the fulfillment of these ideals in the United States, as we recognize that other nations, in Latin America and Asia and Africa, have their own political, economic, and social problems, their unique barriers to the elimination of injustices.&lt;/i&gt;
	
	&lt;i&gt;In some, there is concern that change will submerge the rights of a minority, particularly where the minority is of a different race from the majority. We in the United States believe in the protection of minorities; we recognize the contributions they can make and the leadership they can provide; and we do not believe that any people &#x2014; whether minority, majority, or individual human beings &#x2014; are "expendable" in the cause of theory or policy. We recognize also that justice between men and nations is imperfect, and that humanity sometimes progresses slowly.&lt;/i&gt;
	
	&lt;i&gt;All do not develop in the same manner, or at the same pace. Nations, like men, often march to the beat of different drummers, and the precise solutions of the United States can neither be dictated nor transplanted to others. What is important is that all nations must march toward increasing freedom; toward justice for all; toward a society strong and flexible enough to meet the demands of all its own people, and a world of immense and dizzying change.&lt;/i&gt;
	
	&lt;i&gt;In a few hours, the plane that brought me to this country crossed over oceans and countries which have been a crucible of human history. In minutes we traced the migration of men over thousands of years; seconds, the briefest glimpse, and we passed battlefields on which millions of men once struggled and died. We could see no national boundaries, no vast gulfs or high walls dividing people from people; only nature and the works of man &#x2014; homes and factories and farms &#x2014; everywhere reflecting man's common effort to enrich his life. Everywhere new technology and communications bring men and nations closer together, the concerns of one inevitably becoming the concerns of all. And our new closeness is stripping away the false masks, the illusion of difference which is at the root of injustice and hate and war. Only earthbound man still clings to the dark and poisoning superstition that his world is bounded by the nearest hill, his universe ended at river shore, his common humanity enclosed in the tight circle of those who share his town and views and the color of his skin. It is your job, the task of the young people of this world, to strip the last remnants of that ancient, cruel belief from the civilization of man.&lt;/i&gt;
	
	&lt;i&gt;Each nation has different obstacles and different goals, shaped by the vagaries of history and of experience. Yet as I talk to young people around the world I am impressed not by the diversity but by the closeness of their goals, their desires and their concerns and their hope for the future. There is discrimination in New York, the racial inequality of apartheid in South Africa, and serfdom in the mountains of Peru. People starve in the streets of India, a former Prime Minister is summarily executed in the Congo, intellectuals go to jail in Russia, and thousands are slaughtered in Indonesia; wealth is lavished on armaments everywhere in the world. These are differing evils; but they are the common works of man. They reflect the imperfections of human justice, the inadequacy of human compassion, the defectiveness of our sensibility toward the sufferings of our fellows; they mark the limit of our ability to use knowledge for the well-being of our fellow human beings throughout the world. And therefore they call upon common qualities of conscience and indignation, a shared determination to wipe away the unnecessary sufferings of our fellow human beings at home and around the world.&lt;/i&gt;
	
	&lt;i&gt;It is these qualities which make of youth today the only true international community. More than this I think that we could agree on what kind of a world we would all want to build. It would be a world of independent nations, moving toward international community, each of which protected and respected the basic human freedoms. It would be a world which demanded of each government that it accept its responsibility to insure social justice. It would be a world of constantly accelerating economic progress &#x2014; not material welfare as an end in itself, but as a means to liberate the capacity of every human being to pursue his talents and to pursue his hopes. It would, in short, be a world that we would be proud to have built.&lt;/i&gt;
	
	&lt;i&gt;Just to the north of here are lands of challenge and opportunity-rich in natural resources, land and minerals and people. Yet they are also lands confronted by the greatest odds &#x2014; overwhelming ignorance, internal tensions and strife, and great obstacles of climate and geography. Many of these nations, as colonies, were oppressed and exploited. Yet they have not estranged themselves from the broad traditions of the West; they are hoping and gambling their progress and stability on the chance that we will meet our responsibilities to help them overcome their poverty.&lt;/i&gt;
	
	&lt;i&gt;In the world we would like to build, South Africa could play an outstanding role in that effort. This is without question a preeminent repository of the wealth and knowledge and skill of the continent. Here are the greater part of Africa's research scientists and steel production, most of its reservoirs of coal and electric power. Many South Africans have made major contributions to African technical development and world science; the names of some are known wherever men seek to eliminate the ravages of tropical diseases and pestilence. In your faculties and councils, here in this very audience, are hundreds and thousands of men who could transform the lives of millions for all time to come.&lt;/i&gt;
	
	&lt;i&gt;But the help and the leadership of South Africa or the United States cannot be accepted if we &#x2014; within our own countries or in our relations with others &#x2014; deny individual integrity, human dignity, and the common humanity of man. If we would lead outside our borders, if we would help those who need our assistance, if we would meet our responsibilities to mankind, we must first, all of us, demolish the borders which history has erected between men within our own nations &#x2014; barriers of race and religion, social class and ignorance.&lt;/i&gt;
	
	&lt;i&gt;Our answer is the world's hope; it is to rely on youth. The cruelties and obstacles of this swiftly changing planet will not yield to obsolete dogmas and outworn slogans. It cannot be moved by those who cling to a present which is already dying, who prefer the illusion of security to the excitement and danger which comes with even the most peaceful progress.&lt;/i&gt;
	
	&lt;i&gt;This world demands the qualities of youth; not a time of life but a state of mind, a temper of the will, a quality of the imagination, a predominance of courage over timidity, of the appetite for adventure over the love of ease. It is a revolutionary world we live in, and thus, as I have said in Latin America and Asia, in Europe and in the United States, it is young people who must take the lead. Thus you, and your young compatriots everywhere, have had thrust upon you a greater burden of responsibility than any generation that has ever lived.&lt;/i&gt;
	
	&lt;i&gt;"There is," said an Italian philosopher, "nothing more difficult to take in hand, more perilous to conduct, or more uncertain in its success than to take the lead in the introduction of a new order of things." Yet this is the measure of the task of your generation, and the road is strewn with many dangers.&lt;/i&gt;
	
	&lt;i&gt;First, is the danger of futility: the belief there is nothing one man or one woman can do against the enormous array of the world's ills &#x2014; against misery and ignorance, injustice and violence. Yet many of the world's greatest movements, of thought and action, have flowed from the work of a single man. A young monk began the Protestant Reformation, a young general extended an empire from Macedonia to the borders of the earth, and a young woman reclaimed the territory of France. It was a young Italian explorer who discovered the New World, and the thirty-two-year-old Thomas Jefferson who proclaimed that all men are created equal.&lt;/i&gt;
	
	&lt;i&gt;"Give me a place to stand," said Archimedes, "and I will move the world." These men moved the world, and so can we all. Few will have the greatness to bend history itself, but each of us can work to change a small portion of events, and in the total of all those acts will be written the history of this generation. Thousands of Peace Corps volunteers are making a difference in isolated villages and city slums in dozens of countries. Thousands of unknown men and women in Europe resisted the occupation of the Nazis and many died, but all added to the ultimate strength and freedom of their countries. It is from numberless diverse acts of courage and belief that human history is shaped. Each time a man stands up for an ideal, or acts to improve the lot of others, or strikes out against injustice, he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope, and crossing each other from a million different centers of energy and daring those ripples build a current which can sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and resistance.&lt;/i&gt;
	
	&lt;i&gt;"If Athens shall appear great to you," said Pericles, "consider then that her glories were purchased by valiant men, and by men who learned their duty." That is the source of all greatness in all societies, and it is the key to progress in our time.&lt;/i&gt;
	
	&lt;i&gt;The second danger is that of expediency; of those who say that hopes and beliefs must bend before immediate necessities. Of course, if we would act effectively we must deal with the world as it is. We must get things done. But if there was one thing President Kennedy stood for that touched the most profound feelings of young people around the world, it was the belief that idealism, high aspirations, and deep convictions are not incompatible with the most practical and efficient of programs &#x2014; that there is no basic inconsistency between ideals and realistic possibilities, no separation between the deepest desires of heart and of mind and the rational application of human effort to human problems. It is not realistic or hardheaded to solve problems and take action unguided by ultimate moral aims and values, although we all know some who claim that it is so. In my judgment, it is thoughtless folly. For it ignores the realities of human faith and of passion and of belief &#x2014; forces ultimately more powerful than all of the calculations of our economists or of our generals. Of course to adhere to standards, to idealism, to vision in the face of immediate dangers takes great courage and takes self-confidence. But we also know that only those who dare to fail greatly, can ever achieve greatly.&lt;/i&gt;
	
	&lt;i&gt;It is this new idealism which is also, I believe, the common heritage of a generation which has learned that while efficiency can lead to the camps at Auschwitz, or the streets of Budapest, only the ideals of humanity and love can climb the hills of the Acropolis.&lt;/i&gt;
	
	&lt;i&gt;A third danger is timidity. Few men are willing to brave the disapproval of their fellows, the censure of their colleagues, the wrath of their society. Moral courage is a rarer commodity than bravery in battle or great intelligence. Yet it is the one essential, vital quality of those who seek to change a world which yields most painfully to change. Aristotle tells us that "at the Olympic games it is not the finest and the strongest men who are crowned, but they who enter the lists...&lt;/i&gt;
	
	&lt;i&gt;So too in the life of the honorable and the good it is they who act rightly who win the prize." I believe that in this generation those with the courage to enter the moral conflict will find themselves with companions in every corner of the world.&lt;/i&gt;
	
	&lt;i&gt;For the fortunate among us, the fourth danger is comfort, the temptation to follow the easy and familiar paths of personal ambition and financial success so grandly spread before those who have the privilege of education. But that is not the road history has marked out for us. There is a Chinese curse which says, "May he live in interesting times." Like it or not we live in interesting times. They are times of danger and uncertainty; but they are also more open to the creative energy of men than any other time in history. And everyone here will ultimately be judged &#x2014; will ultimately judge himself &#x2014; on the effort he has contributed to building a new world society and the extent to which his ideals and goals have shaped that effort.&lt;/i&gt;
	
	&lt;i&gt;So we part, I to my country and you to remain. We are &#x2014; if a man of forty can claim that privilege &#x2014; fellow members of the world's largest younger generation. Each of us have our own work to do. I know at times you must feel very alone with your problems and difficulties. But I want to say how impressed I am with what you stand for and the effort you are making; and I say this not just for myself, but for men and women everywhere. And I hope you will often take heart from the knowledge that you are joined with fellow young people in every land, they struggling with their problems and you with yours, but all joined in a common purpose; that, like the young people of my own country and of every country I have visited, you are all in many ways more closely united to the brothers of your time than to the older generations of any of these nations; and that you are determined to build a better future. President Kennedy was speaking to the young people of America, but beyond them to young people everywhere, when he said that "the energy, the faith, the devotion which we bring to this endeavor will light our country and all who serve it &#x2014; and the glow from that fire can truly light the world."&lt;/i&gt;
	
	&lt;i&gt;And he added, "With a good conscience our only sure reward, with history the final judge of our deeds, let us go forth to lead the land we love, asking His blessing and His help, but knowing that here on earth God's work must truly be our own."&lt;/i&gt;

    <title>Piedmont News Blotter: Wednesday, June 6</title>
    <subhead></subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>&lt;div&gt;News and Notes from the Piedmont and Triangle.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;(GOVERNMENT) &#x2014; Former Raleigh City Council member Mary-Ann Baldwin was removed from her appointed position on the GoTriangle Board of Trustees on a 5-3 City Council vote Tuesday, June 5. The GoTriangle board oversees the public transit system connecting all major municipalities in the Triangle.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;Council members Russ Stephenson, Dickie Thompson, David Cox, Kay Crowder and Stef Mendell voted in favor of Baldwin&#x2019;s removal, while Mayor Nancy McFarlane and Council members Nicole Stewart and Corey Branch voted against the removal.&amp;nbsp;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;Baldwin has spoken publicly about the decision, referring to her ousting as &#x201C;political payback&#x201D; for her criticism of former colleagues for opposing residential zoning of affordable backyard cottages and short-term leases for the working poor. Baldwin has claimed that her dismissal was not transparently discussed internally or publicly.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;Cox has rebutted Baldwin's accusations. A desire to have elected representation on the GoTriangle board was cited as one reason council members voted for her removal. Baldwin became a board member while she was an elected City Council member, and has since had that term end.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;Stephenson will replace Baldwin for the remainder of the four-year appointment.&amp;nbsp;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;(POLITICS) &#x2014; A demonstration at the Bicentennial Plaza on Jones Street in Raleigh, organized by the North Carolina branch of the national Poor People&#x2019;s Campaign, resulted in the arrest of 13 individuals on Monday, June 4. Those taken into custody were among approximately 150 activists who attempted to enter the main legislative building.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;According to the Associated Press, 87 people have been arrested since campaigns launching in mid-May and charged with trespassing. Reverend William Barber, the social justice movement leader who started the Moral Mondays campaign to petition the North Carolina government in Raleigh, is leading the national Poor People&#x2019;s Campaign.&amp;nbsp;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;(NATURE) &#x2014; Two endangered red wolf pups born at the North Carolina Zoo in April were euthanized after being critically injured by their father. Finnick, the six-year-old male red wolf whose mate, Ayita, gave birth to the pups in April, attacked and injured two of the litter on May 29.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;Hurricane and Typhoon were born April 15, part of a litter of five American red wolves born at the zoo under the American Red Wolf Recovery Program. The American red wolves were part of the zoo&#x2019;s breeding program with the Association of Zoos and Aquariums Saving Species from Extinction, according to the North Carolina Zoo.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;Zoo workers euthanized them after the adult wolf delivered injuries were assessed by zoo officials to be too severe. &#x201C;Zoo and veterinarian staff made the difficult decision to humanely euthanize them based on quality of life factors,&#x201D; reads a news release posted on the zoo&#x2019;s Facebook page. &#x201C;Staff determined the father caused the injuries, but the cause of this parental aggression is unknown.&#x201D;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;Wolf pups Thor, Thunder and Oklahoma are healthy and active. Their father has been separated from the litter.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;div&gt;(OBITUARY) &#x2014; Services took place last weekend for two South Carolina reporters killed in Polk County on Thursday, May 28 while reporting on recent storms.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;Mike McCormick, a news anchor, and Aaron Smeltzer, a news photographer, were killed when a tree fell on their vehicle. They were reporting on severe weather for WYFF, an NBC-affiliated television station serving the Greenville, South Carolina, area.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;Smeltzer was born in Tazewell, Virginia, and had previously worked for CBS-affiliated WSPA in Spartanburg.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Funeral services for Mike McCormick were held in Spartanburg last Saturday.

    <body>News and notes from the Piedmont and Triangle.
	
	&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Orange County&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
	
	(EDUCATION) &#x2014; The Duke Energy Foundation has granted the Chapel Hill&#x2013;Carrboro City School system $40,000 to support a new science technology engineering and math (STEM) program at Northside elementary school. The money will be used to provide training for primary-grade-level teachers in the instruction of natural sciences and critical thinking. The initiative is targeted primarily at third and fourth grade teachers, since a part of the driving philosophy of the program is to instill these modes thought in children at an early age. It is also expected to increase fifth grade standardized test scores. The grant application was originally submitted by the instructional services staffers under Sustainability Director Dan Schnitzer of Chapel Hill&#x2013;Carrboro City Schools.
	
	(DEVELOPMENT) &#x2014; The town of Carrboro announced through a press release this past week that developer P. H. Craig will be clear-cutting 40 acres of timber near Bolin Creek in 2018. Though a small section lies within the Chapel Hill town limits, the parcel of land in question is in an extraterritorial jurisdiction, meaning that no local ordinances governing the removal of forestry can be applied to the project, while state and federal laws can. The town&#x2019; sstatement indicated that a 50-foot buffer between the creek and the clearage border will be implemented. It also comes on the heels of Chapel Hill having begun to clear 15 acres of land it owns near Estes Drive. The date for breaking ground has not been publicly announced. 
	
	(NATURE) &#x2014; The North Carolina State Laboratory of Public Health revealed on Wednesday, June 7 that the year&#x2019;s second case of rabies has been confirmed after the owners of two dogs alerted animal control authorities about a dead raccoon on their Rougemont property that they feared their animals had come into contact with. The dogs were up to date on all their vaccinations but will be monitored by county veterinary nurses to make sure that no infection occurred. The dogs will also be required to get booster shots. Had they not been vaccinated, they would have been entered into a four-month quarantine process. Raccoons and bats are the most common carriers of rabies in Orange County. Nine cases of rabies were confirmed in both 2016 and 2017.
	
	&lt;br&gt;
	
	&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Durham&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
	
	(GOVERNMENT) &#x2014; Prominent members of Durham&#x2019;s Jewish community have asked the city council to publicly acknowledge that its April 16 statement promising residents that local law enforcement personnel would not be trained by Israeli defense experts, was in fact, an &#x201C;act of governmental discrimination.&#x201D; Multiple Jewish advocacy groups officially petitioned the city on Tuesday night at a meeting of the Durham Human Relations Committee, asking council members to &#x201C;issue a statement of findings&#x201D; admitting that officials chose to arbitrarily single out Israel as a purveyor of overzealous police tactics. Members of the council told local media that the original statement was an attempt to arrive at a compromise in view of a separate petition made previously by groups demanding that Durham ban all future partnership with Israeli law enforcement. Jewish Federation of Durham-Chapel Hill CEO Jill Madsen described the council&#x2019;s behavior as &#x201C;anti-Semitic,&#x201D; and said that incidents of prejudice against Jewish individuals in the area have risen in recent years, citing a 2017 bomb threat at the Lerner Jewish Community Day School as a piece of evidence.&amp;nbsp;
	
	&lt;br&gt;
	
	&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Chatham County&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
	
	(DEVELOPMENT)  &#x2014; On April 19, Chatham County&#x2019;s Brier Chapel neighborhood community association voted to capture, then kill, 35 beavers that are currently damming Pokeberry Creek, potentially raising future water levels. Only two days later, after an online petition to grant clemency to the beavers gained numerous signatures, community leaders and officials with the U.S. Department of Agricultural agreed to reevaluate the decision. The agreement does not guarantee the future safety of the animals, but non-lethal options are being explored. A statement sent out to all association members by the Brier Chapel Board of Directors read, in part, &#x201C;We have communicated with the US Department of Agriculture and have discussed having additional consultation before any work is done.&#x201D;
	
	&lt;br&gt;
	
	&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;State News&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
	
	(MILITARY) &#x2014; The late Captain James Gallagher of the United States Army was denied military burial rights at the Sandhills State Veterans Cemetery in Spring Lake, North Carolina, even after his wife Amanda requested an exception to the regulation that a deceased soldier must have lived in the state for at least 10 years to qualify for a full and free veteran plot and funeral. Captain Gallagher was a West Point graduate and an Iraq War veteran stationed in Fort Lee, Virginia, who passed away suddenly at age 31. Amanda Gallagher moved to North Carolina from Virginia, where the couple had been stationed, in order to be closer to her family after the death. Larry Hall, of The North Carolina Secretary of Veteran Affairs office, told ABC News that no exception was possible. Mrs. Gallagher reached out to Governor Roy Cooper, who attempted to make an arrangement between the family and a federal burial ground in Salisbury; that was deemed unsatisfactory to the family. The Veteran&#x2019;s Affairs office statement read, "While this was an unusual situation, it is clear that the [state] Department of Military and Veterans Affairs should continue to work with legislators to review these policies and ensure that they serve the needs North Carolina&#x2019;s veterans and military families.&#x201D; Captain Gallagher&#x2019;s body is now in a morgue until Arlington National Cemetery can admit him.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;</body>

	&lt;br&gt;
	
	&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Triangle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
	
	(BUSINESS) &#x2014; Grocery store chain Kroger announced on Wednesday, June 13 that it will close all of its Triangle locations by August 14. In its press release, the company said, &#x201C;After a thorough evaluation of the market for a significant time period, we have decided to close our stores in the highly competitive Raleigh-Durham market.&#x201D;
	
	The store locations will be sold to other businesses, with Food Lion and Crunch Fitness currently under contract for two of the locations. The closings will affect 1,500 full- and part-time employees.
	
	Kroger purchased the Harris Teeter grocery store chain in January of 2014 for $2.4 billion and is in the process of converting eight of its stores to bear the Harris Teeter brand instead of that of its national parent company. Harris Teeter released its own statement reading, in part, &#x201C;We plan to invest in remodeling a number of these locations to better serve our shoppers in this growing and vibrant market.&#x201D;&amp;nbsp;
	
	&lt;br&gt;
	
	&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Durham&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
	
	(CRIME) &#x2014; Attorney Ian Mance of the Southern Coalition for Social Justice spoke at a public hearing regarding Durham County&#x2019;s 2018&#x2013;2019 spending plan and accused officials of negligence in the hanging death of Uniece &#x201C;Niecey&#x201D; Fennell, who committed suicide on March 23, 2017 in her jail cell.
	
	Citing a 2002 memorandum circulated by former Sheriff Worth Hill which warned of &#x201C;hanging hazards&#x201D; in some areas of the county jail, Mance said that &#x201C;this commission took no action, and chose not to spend the modest sum of money, less than $100,000, that it would have taken to address the issue.&#x201D;
	
	Mance is currently representing Fennell&#x2019;s mother, Julia Graves. Mance also claims that in 2003, Sheriff Hill again asked the county for money to address the safety concern, but the County Commission chose not to allocate the funds. Commissioners at Monday&#x2019;s hearing did not respond to Mance&#x2019;s comments.
	
	Fennell was being held on $5 million bond for the July 10 murder of Andre Bond, who was killed in what is believed to be a drive-by shooting on Woodview Drive.&amp;nbsp;
	
	&lt;br&gt;
	
	&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;State News&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;  
	
	(HEALTH) &#x2014; The North Carolina Suicide Prevention Lifeline received a nearly 100 percent increase in call volume in the days after the high-profile deaths of fashion designer Kate Spade and chef Anthony Bourdain, it was reported this week. The suicide hotline normally averages around 255 calls a day but received 467 calls on Friday, one day after Bourdain&#x2019;s death and three days after Spade&#x2019;s death, according to Greenville call-referral service REAL Crisis Intervention.
	
	Suicide is now the 10th leading cause of death in the United States, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, which coincidentally released its latest data on the issue the same week Spade and Bourdain took their lives. That report indicated that North Carolina&#x2019;s suicide rate rose by 12.7 percent between 1996 and 2016, with approximately one suicide every six hours in the state.</body>

	&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Orange County&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
	
	(EMERGENCY) &#x2014; The Carrboro Police Department is still investigating a fatal vehicle collision that took place on Tuesday, June 12 at the intersection of NC-54 and Main Street adjacent Carrboro Plaza. The crash left 86-year-old Chapel Hill resident Rita Slotnick dead after the car she and her husband were driving made contact with a logging truck. Slotnick&#x2019;s husband was rushed to UNC hospital to be treated for severe injuries.
	
	According to their official press release, Carrboro PD noted that Slotnick &#x201C;was initially pinned in and had to be extricated by Carrboro Fire-Rescue personnel&#x2026;. The driver of the second vehicle was not injured.&#x201D; 
	
	Officials have not made public which of the pair was driving when the incident occurred. No charges have been filed as of this publication. Anyone with information is encouraged to call investigator Mike Metz at (919) 918-7409.
	
	&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
	
	Durham&lt;/span&gt;(COMMUNITY) &#x2014; The Durham City Council approved the creation of a 12-member Racial Equity Task Force this past week after first discussing it in open session at their June 7 meeting. Among its stated goals, as established in an internal Council email now published on the city&#x2019;s website, are to &#x201C;research and collect public opinion on models, policy changes and social interventions to address racial inequity that represent current best practices that have been successful in other cities&#x201D; and to &#x201C;issue policy and funding recommendations to the city...to address racial inequity.&#x201D;Positions on the task force will be open to any current Durham residents looking to increase their civic engagement, although applications will not be available online until later this summer. 
	
	It will be overseen by Mayor Pro Tempore Jillian Johnson and, according to the task forces&#x2019; bylaws, will meet regularly for one year before issuing a summary of its findings.&amp;nbsp;
	
	&lt;br&gt;
	
	(CRIME) &#x2014; Homicide detectives with the Durham Police Department are attempting to track down suspects and witnesses in connection with a shooting that took place on the afternoon of Friday, June 15 at the intersection of North Guthrie Avenue and Lathrop Street.
	
	The victim, 25-year-old Tyrique Reddick, is believed to have been targeted from a moving car. After the attack, he walked from the crime scene to Park Avenue, and from there was transported to a local trauma ward, where he died. The number of bullet wounds he sustained is uncertain, only confirmed by public Durham PD affairs manager Wil Glen as &#x201C;multiple hits.&#x201D;
	
	Those who may have pertinent information are asked to call investigator E. Ortiz at (919) 560-4440, ext. 29337.
	
	&lt;br&gt;
	
	&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Raleigh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&lt; a=""&gt;(POLICE) &#x2014; Following a State Bureau of Investigation review of the dashcam recording from the vehicle of two North Carolina Highway Patrol troopers suspected of using excessive force during the April 3 arrest of Kyron Hinton, both officers were fired from their positions on Friday, June 15.&lt;p&gt;
	
	The video of the incident, part of which has been made publicly available, shows an intense scuffle involving former troopers Michael Blake and Tabithia Davis, four additional highway patrol troopers and a police dog, and Hinton. It appears that the dog was sent by his handler, Deputy Cameron Broadwell, to attack Hinton, which brought him to the ground. There  he was descended upon by the group of uniformed officers who struggled to keep him down.
	
	Hinton sustained multiple injuries, including bites from the dog and a broken eye socket. The incident was precipitated by a 911 call reporting a man waving a gun and screaming at traffic. Investigators found no gun on or near Hinton, but he did admit to being intoxicated at the time. An SBI affidavit revealed that that dashcam audio picked up not only directives to punch Hinton in the head with a flashlight during the melee, but also an admission of the assault in the immediate aftermath, as well as direct instructions from Sergeant R. W. Goswick to file false paperwork denying the assault. 
	
	Blake, Davis, and Deputy Cameron Broadwell have all been indicted for assault with a deadly weapon. Sergeant Goswick has been placed on administrative leave.&amp;nbsp;
	
	&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
	
	State News&lt;/span&gt;(EDUCATION) &#x2014; The NAACP&#x2019;s North Carolina chapter is threatening legal action against the state over last week&#x2019;s legislative vote to allow four municipalities in Mecklenburg County to establish charter schools and restrict matriculation to students living in those towns. The bill was drafted as a local measure, meaning it never made it to Governor Roy Cooper&#x2019;s desk, since his signature was not required for ratification under current General Assembly rules.
	
	The towns in question &#x2014; Cornelius, Huntersville, Matthews and Mint Hill &lt;span style='display: inline !important; float: none; background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: "open-sans",serif; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-justify: auto; text-transform: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;'&gt;&#x2014;&lt;/span&gt; are all located in the metropolitan Charlotte area and are mostly populated by white people. Residents advocating the law claim that the Charlotte-Mecklenburg School (CMS) system has not provided adequate public education to much of the suburban community, and that having a charter option will do so. Those in opposition, including a handful of former CMS board chair holders, view the move as a step toward re-segregation. 
	
	CMS has a history of legal battle over school integration; in 1971, it was the landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision of Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education that upheld busing students of different races to schools further away as a remedy for the segregation remaining from Jim Crow&#x2013;era housing and education discrimination.&lt;/p&lt;&gt;</body>

	&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Orange County&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
	
	(EDUCATION) &#x2014; The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill announced on June 18 in a press release that the William R. Kenan, Jr. Charitable Trust has made a $1.53 million gift to its School of Law to support a clinical entrepreneurship program to train future attorneys in the skills required to provide early-stage legal counsel to start-up companies.
	
	&#x201C;Legal advice for early-stage businesses and nonprofits, which typically have limited resources, is hard to find,&#x201D; the statement read. &#x201C;In the end, students, startup businesses, communities and the state&#x2019;s economy will end up benefiting.&#x201D;
	
	The funds will also be counted as part of the &#x201C;Campaign for Carolina&#x201D; initiative, which seeks to raise $4.25 billion for the university by the end of 2022.
	
	The William R. Kenan, Jr. Charitable Trust was established in 1966 by the titular chemist and industrialist; it bestows grants for efforts in the arts, education and basic human needs.&amp;nbsp;
	
	&lt;br&gt;
	
	&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Durham&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
	
	(EMERGENCY) &#x2014; Two men and a woman were found dead in the residential swimming pool of a Durham apartment complex at approximately 3 AM on Tuesday, June 19. None of the three have yet been identified by law enforcement, but The News &amp;amp; Observer &lt;a href="http://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/article213514859.html" target="_blank"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that, according to an anonymous witness to the incident, all three appeared to be teenagers, and that among the bagged evidence was a beer can.
	
	Upon discovery, multiple individuals attempted to apply CPR. When on-scene attempts failed, the three were transported from the Chapel Tower complex to Duke University hospital, where they were all pronounced dead.
	
	&amp;nbsp;
	
	&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Wake County&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
	
	(GOVERNMENT) &#x2014; According to a recent internal municipal audit, approximately 2,500 residents are inappropriately taking advantage of a backyard trash pick-up service provided by the city of Raleigh for those deemed incapable of placing their garbage containers curbside.
	
	The program costs the city approximately $500,000 and employs seven sanitation workers to cover the 4,404 residents currently enrolled. As of the most recent regulation adjustment in 2013, the initiative is intended for only those who are medically or physically unable to move large objects, with a doctor&#x2019;s note required as proof. However, a lack of procedural oversight has allowed many unqualified participants to slip through the cracks.
	
	The city is now in the process of contacting all of the participants and informing them that reapplication will be mandatory for those who do not wish to be purged from the list by July of 2019, when officials hope to have the revamped program implemented.
	
	&lt;br&gt;
	
	(CRIME) &#x2014; A senior administrator at Central Prison in Raleigh was hospitalized with critical injuries after being attacked by two inmates with makeshift weaponry at 12:30 PM, on Tuesday, June 19. The victim, Brent Soucier, was reportedly lacerated, stabbed and beaten severely before guards were able to subdue the perpetrators. He has been employed by the state prison system for almost 20 years, and is currently recovering and in stable condition.
	
	 
	
	In November of 2017, the Charlotte Observer reported on &#x201C;dangerous shortages&#x201D; of correctional staff after the death of five guards at the hands of prisoners that year in two separate attacks in eastern North Carolina. Officer retention, rather than hiring difficulties, has been cited as the primary staffing challenge by state prison officials.
	
	&lt;br&gt;
	
	&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;State News&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
	
	(IMMIGRATION) &#x2014; On Tuesday, June 19, North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper made the decision to remove three NC National Guard members from the United States southern border with Mexico in response to the Trump Administration&#x2019;s controversial policy of separation of undocumented immigrants from the children who traveled with them. Cooper&#x2019;s statement to the media read in part, "The cruel policy of tearing children away from their parents requires a strong response.&#x201D;
	
	The state&#x2019;s National Guard has been providing the U.S. Border Patrol with aerial surveillance since 2012, with an outfit of three guardsman and one helicopter.
	
	On the same day, North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein joined 20 of his Democratic colleagues across the nation in writing a letter to U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions demanding an end to the policy, stating, &#x201C;The administration must cease this cruelty immediately."
	
	Governors of eight different states, both Democrats and Republicans, are also recalling their Guard members in protest.&amp;nbsp;
	
	&lt;br&gt;
	
	&lt;br&gt;
	
	CORRECTION: In the initial posted version of this story it was reported in the Durham Emergency section that multiple beer cans were taken into evidence, but the News &amp;amp; Observer article as of 11 AM Wednesday, June 20 reported only one taken into evidence.</body>

A community of Dutch nationals have been calling the Triangle home for many years, and corporate interests from The Netherlands are already established throughout North Carolina and the United States.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;According to Chapel Hill Mayor Pam Hemminger the visit was also in part a symbolic gesture, as orange is the official color of the Dutch royal family, prompting visits by diplomatic attach&#xE9;s to make stops in similarly named counties in other states.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;Also discussed was the controversial HB2 &#x201C;bathroom bill&#x201D; law that affected transgender individuals and municipal anti-discrimination efforts, and the unique challenges a concentrated population of liberal voters faces in an otherwise conservative state.&amp;nbsp;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;(DEVELOPMENT) &#x2013; Approximately 200 people calling themselves The Friends of Bolin Creek met at Smith Middle School Thursday, June 21 to discuss ways to prevent the clearcutting of forest in Chapel Hill and Carrboro by property owner P. H. Craig.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;Proposals included negotiations with Craig to sell a portion of the land, as well as a bond referendum that would allow both towns to purchase the $2.4 million property and make it public.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;Among those in attendance were Chapel Hill Mayor Pam Hemminger, Carrboro Planning Director Patricia McGuire, Tom Cors of The Nature Conservancy and Triangle Land Conservancy&#x2019;s photographer Mary Sonis and conservation and stewardship manager Bo Howes.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;Craig is expected to make a profit of up to $200,000 from harvesting the 34-acre property, and says that he is choosing to do so now because of concerns about fire and insect hazards. He was unable to attend the meeting due to being in the hospital. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Durham&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;(CRIME) &#x2014;The Durham Police Department is still searching for a second suspect tied to the kidnapping and robbery of 22-year-old Antonio Cornejo in the early morning hours of June 14. In the complaint he filed with the department, Cornejo says he was approached at a gas station at approximately 1 AM by two men who forced him back into his vehicle at gunpoint. The suspects then drove to three different ATM machines, each time demanding that Cornejo withdraw cash from his account, before he escaped on foot.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;When responding to a disturbance call, police found the victim&#x2019;s truck six days later in the parking lot of Bull City Market on Broad Street and arrested one of the alleged kidnappers.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;The name of the second suspect has not been released, but a surveillance photo of a white male with red hair has been released. Anyone with knowledge of his whereabouts is encouraged to call police at 919-560-4440.&amp;nbsp;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;(FOOD) &#x2014; Mixology enthusiasts and locavores will be pleased to hear that a new farm-to-cocktail bar will be opening its doors in late 2018, adding a new ingredient to Durham&#x2019;s already vibrant restaurant scene.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;The establishment will be named Kingfisher, said its owner, Cary native Sean Umstead. The lounge will be located at 321 East Chapel Hill Street, adjacent to the Durham Hotel at 315 East Chapel Hill Street.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;Umstead plans to showcase North Carolina products, in various stages of fermentation and distillation, alongside an array of conventional and specialty spirits, which would require a seasonally shifting menu.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;Umstead has worked in Triangle kitchens as well as restaurants in New York City. He will co-own the establishment with his wife, designer and artist Michelle Vanderwalker, who will be responsible for cultivating the bar&#x2019;s atmosphere and interior aesthetics.&amp;nbsp;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;(MEDIA) &#x2014; Subscription video streaming website Netflix re-released and added to the 2004 true-crime classic series &#x201C;The Staircase&#x201D; on Friday, June 8, once again thrusting novelist and accused murderer Michael Peterson and his home city of Durham into the national spotlight.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;The TV miniseries, directed by Jean-Xavier de Lestrade, premiered on French television as &#x201C;Soup&#xE7;ons&#x201D; (meaning &#x201C;suspicions&#x201D;), an eight-episode arc of the investigation and first trial. It was praised by critics for its insider access and adeptness at highlighting the drama in even the most banal legal discussions. Lestrade uncovered a narrative where dozens of red herrings and forensic anomalies were weaponized by both the prosecution and defense, creating drama and suspense.&amp;nbsp;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;In 2013, Lestrade released a film, now made into two episodes, following up on Peterson&#x2019;s legal battle. Now, through Netflix, he has released a final three episodes covering the last trial, in 2017.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;The trial ended with Peterson entering an Alford plea agreeing to be treated as guilty by admitting the prosecutors had the requisite evidence to convicting. However, under an Alford plea, he maintains his innocence. The judge sentenced Peterson to a maximum of 86 months in prison, with credit for time served. Having already served more than that, he was released from custody.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;Peterson&#x2019;s novels were mostly military and included &#x201C;The Immortal Dragon&#x201D;, &#x201C;A Time of War&#x201D; and &#x201C;A Bitter Peace&#x201D;. Peterson&#x2019;s modest authorial success prior to his fall from grace gave him local celebrity status. The Sundial reached out to the owner of Durham&#x2019;s 9th Street&#x2019;s Regulator Bookshop, Wander Lorentz de Haas, who remembers Peterson&#x2019;s frequent visits to the store in the late 1990s.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&#x201C;He was very gregarious and well-liked... When he came in, he seemed like one of those types where everyone knew him,&#x201D; said de Haas. However, he went on to say, the moment news of his arrest hit the front page, &#x201C;It was one of those classic situations where no one wanted to be seen with a copy of one of his books.&#x201D;&amp;nbsp;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;The Sundial also reached out to the Durham City Police for comment and received from public information officer Kammie Michael, &#x201C;We don&#x2019;t have anything to add at this time.&#x201D;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Raleigh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;(COMMUNITY) &#x2014; The Carolina Peace Center (CPC), an organization whose stated mission is to &#x201C;cultivate justice and peace across diverse social and political groups by building grassroots networks to educate and advocate for systemic change,&#x201D; held a rally at Bicentennial Plaza on Wednesday, June 14 to protest current immigration policies.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;The rally was held just hours after President Donald Trump signed an executive order to keep families entering the country illegally from being separated by immigration enforcement officials, although the rally was planned well in advance of the order.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;Organizers and rally speakers, including local religious leaders and civil rights attorneys, called on the federal government to implement a less draconian border control policy.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;In her speech, CPC spokesperson Faisal Khan told the crowd, &#x201C;It's incumbent upon us as citizens of the United States to stand up and speak out and keep calling our legislators, keep writing them, keep visiting them and keep reinforcing it.&#x201D; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;State News&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;(HEALTH) &#x2014; The North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality has conducted water tests near the Chemours industrial chemical plant after having installed filtration systems in six area homes. They were specifically looking for the compound GenX, which has been the subject of controversy for some time due to its contamination of local well water and its unknown effects on human health. Although no scientific studies have been conducted to evaluate human consumption of GenX, limited testing on animals has linked it to cancer.&amp;nbsp;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;According to state officials, each activated carbon filter the state installed is able to effectively remove more than a dozen foreign compounds from the water source to which it is applied.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;The Chemours plant, located in Bladen County, produces GenX primarily for companies manufacturing nonstick cookware. Chemours was founded in 2015 as a spin-off company of DuPont.&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</body>

    <title>Charlotte Hornets On Summer Hot Stove</title>
    <subhead>June 21 NBA Draft and Howard Trade Stir Comment</subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>New faces are stacked at the top and the bottom of the totem pole for the Charlotte Hornets as the NBA draft supplies a crop of youngsters and new general manager Mitch Kupchak contemplates changes to the starting five.
	
	Michael Jordan and the team&#x2019;s other owners will be watching Kupchak&#x2019;s moves this off-season, and will be peering over the new GM&#x2019;s shoulder as the fate of seasons looms uncertain, lofted upon the winds of this summer&#x2019;s decisions.
	
	The question for Kupchak, no stranger to NBA championships, is whether to make chess moves with the team that finished third in the Southeast Division last season, or to knock over the chessboard and start a fresh team with no chance for a ring in 2018-19, sights set on the future.
	
	The Hornets will participate in the NBA Summer League basketball beginning July 6, when young players from all 30 NBA teams will play in an 82-game tournament over 12 days at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.
	
	Kupchak, a retired Los Angeles Lakers center and power forward,  took over as general manager in April.  Kupchak played college ball at  the University of North Carolina, won an Olympic gold medal in 1976, and three NBA championships
	
	As general manager of the Lakers, Kupchak was responsible for bringing Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O&#x2019;Neal to the Lakers and winning multiple NBA titles with them.
	
	Kupchak began his front-office tenure with the Hornets by saying that he liked where Charlotte was and would probably not blow the team up.  He also said he would like to see franchise player Kemba Walker (a 2011 first-round Charlotte pick when the team was called The Bobcats) finish his career as a Hornet.  
	
	The 2017-18 Hornets finished with a losing record of 36-46. Kupchak has already begun the blowup of the Hornets by trading Dwight Howard, with his outsized locker room presence and $23 million contract, to the Brooklyn Nets. 
	
	Kupchak came to believe that Hornets players had stopped listening to head coach Steve Clifford midway through last season, according to their comments and media reports, and that it would be good to turn the page. Clifford was fired with a year remaining on his contract. 
	
	James Borrego, a young assistant coach under Greg Popovich in San Antonio for the last three years, was hired as the Hornets&#x2019; new head coach shortly after Kupchak became GM.  Kupchak reportedly has told Borrego to focus on player development, another indication of his intent to rebuild with younger players.
	
	But Kupchak traded Howard for 7&#x2019;1&#x201D; center Timofey Mosgov whose age is 31 and whose contract weighs in at $16 million. (Ironically, Kupchak signed Mosgrov to a four-year $16 million contract with the Lakers in 2016.) And Kupchak&#x2019;s draft choices are already generating sparks.
	
	The Hornets drafted DeVonte&#x2019; Graham, from the University of Kansas and Hamidou Diallo from the University of Kentucky. Their first-round acquisition was Miles Bridges, a small forward out of Michigan State. With the 55th overall pick the Hornets drafted Arnoldas Kulboka from Lithuania, who management says will play overseas for a year or two, as he seasons from a nineteen-year-old into a player ready for the bright lights of the Spectrum Center.
	
	Although many draft-watchers Thursday were ecstatic that the slightly-injured small forward Michael Porter Jr. had fallen enough for the Hornets to take him 11th overall, the Hornets instead took Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and then traded him to the Los Angeles Clippers for the 12th pick and two future second round picks. The Clippers then selected Miles Bridges for the Hornets with the 12th pick. 
	
	Porter Jr. was the 2017 McDonald&#x2019;s All-American MVP and one of the top-ranked prep playersin the nation. Porter has the potential to be a major star, and thus a difficult prospect to pass up. But instead of the big-bust-or-big-reward route, Kupchak played it safe by drafting Bridges.
	
	The Hornets are catching flak for players they chose not to select in the draft. Porter Jr. has just come off of back surgery, dissuading many GMs from drafting him, but he was nevertheless selected by the Denver Nuggets as the 14th overall pick.
	
	Howard, who had a comeback season last year has a rocky past relationship with Kupchak:  Howard played one year in LA for Kupchak while he was experiencing his bad back issues, and Kupchak sent Dwight a &#x201C;Dear John&#x201D; when he declined to resign him in 2013.  That move may have been what caused Los Angeles to send Kupchak packing. </body>

    <title>Light Rail Given Fresh Chance, Fewer Funds</title>
    <subhead></subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>&#xD;
		&#xD;
			&#xD;
		&#xD;
		&#xD;
			RALEIGH &#x2014; A law passed Tuesday could save the Durham-Orange Light Rail Transit (DOLRT) project. The proposed transit system would run from UNC Hospitals in Chapel Hill to North Carolina Central University in Durham, almost 18 miles, with 19 proposed stops.
	
	The budget passed by the North Carolina General Assembly previously mandated that for light rail projects have all non-state funds, including federal funds, be secured before any state money is allocated. However, the federal government requires the reverse: that all state funds be committed before federal money is allocated. 
	
	Before Tuesday&#x2019;s changes, chambers of commerce for Durham and Chapel Hill released &lt;a href="https://www.carolinachamber.org/news/details/joint-statement-on-light-rail" target="_blank"&gt;a joint statement,&lt;/a&gt; and the Orange County Board of Commissioners released &lt;a href="http://www.orangecountync.gov/news_detail_T4_R1071.php" target="_blank"&gt;a separate statement,&lt;/a&gt; expressing disappointment in the budget language that endangered the DOLRT. The Orange County commissioners&#x2019; statement suggested a revision similar to the one passed Tuesday.
	
	The NCGA passed that state budget for the 2018&#x2013;2019 fiscal year on June 12, overriding Governor Roy Cooper&#x2019;s veto. 
	
	Tuesday&#x2019;s changes are part of a bill of technical corrections to items on the budget. It became law without Governor Cooper&#x2019;s signature. The new language lets state funds be allocated, though still not spent, once the project provides to the N.C. Department of Transportation written confirmation that all non-state funding has been committed.
	
	Another part of the corrections decreases state funding for DOLRT to $190 million of the projected costs of $3.3 billion and sets a deadline of April 30, 2019 for all non-state and non-federal funding to be committed.
	
	The reduction in allowable state monies has created a funding gap of almost $57 million for DOLRT. Durham and Orange counties will work with GoTriangle, a cross-municipal organization managing the Triangle&#x2019;s public transportation, to seek possible funding sources to fill in the gap.
	
	Jeff Mann, a manager at GoTriangle, told Orange County commissioners at a June 21 meeting that they will have proposals by mid-August.
	
	At the same meeting, Scott Polikov, founder of Gateway Planning, a Dallas-based company that drafted light rail station plans for GoTriangle, highlighted the light rail project&#x2019;s apparent national approval.
	
	&#x201C;Doesn&#x2019;t it say something that this [Federal Transit Administration] grant...was awarded under a prior administration, and you all moved into final engineering under this administration?&#x201D; Polikov asked. &#x201C;You&#x2019;re in rare company. You&#x2019;ve been basically endorsed by both recent presidential administrations and the FTA. That&#x2019;s a big deal.&#x201D;&lt;div class="calendarArticlePhotoBox" id="CalendarArticlePhotoBox-88//"&gt;&#xD;
		&#xD;
		September 2016 proposed map of the DOLRT, by GoTriangle. Since this drafting, a stop near to Durham Performing Arts Center has been added.&#xD;

    <title>Piedmont News Blotter: Wednesday, June 27</title>
    <subhead></subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>News and notes from the Triangle and Piedmont.
	
	&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;State News&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
	
	(GOVERNMENT) &#x2014; The Supreme Court of the United States decided on Monday, June 25 that it would not rule on a North Carolina gerrymandering dispute, but instead would send the case back down to a federal district court.
	
	SCOTUS directed that the judgment employ principles from the 9-0 SCOTUS decision in Gill v. Whitford handed down on June 18. That decision blocked a suit brought against Wisconsin lawmakers and their recently redrawn congressional map because "concrete and particularized" damages could not be proven by the plaintiff. 
	
	The three-judge district court panel had previously struck down North Carolina&#x2019;s latest district boundaries, declaring them to be unconstitutionally favoring Republican politicians by design. It was the first time a federal court declared a gerrymandered map unconstitutional based solely on partisan considerations, rather than racial or ethnic considerations. SCOTUS has previously declared racial gerrymandering out of bounds, but has never ruled that a map redrawn to favor a specific party violated federal law. 
	
	The Federal District Court of NC now must evaluate the case using the Wisconsin ruling as a precedent to determine whether the plaintiff, Common Cause North Carolina, can prove &#x201C;direct injury&#x201D; and does in fact have standing to sue. If the District Court holds to its original ruling, the Supreme Court may have to examine the case again.&amp;nbsp;
	
	&lt;br&gt;
	
	(OBITUARY) &#x2014; History Channel television star, pawnbroker and antiquities expert Richard &#x201C;Old Man&#x201D; Harrison died of complications from Parkinson&#x2019;s disease on the morning of Monday, June 25 at age 77.
	
	Harrison grew up in Lexington, North Carolina, where one of his first jobs was driving a public school bus starting at age 14. When Harrison was 21, he was arrested for stealing a car and ordered by the court to join the military. He retired from the Navy after two decades of service and moved with his family to Las Vegas, where he and his son, Rick Harrison, opened the World Famous Gold &amp;amp; Silver Pawn shop in 1989. 
	
	The History Channel contracted with the Harrisons to host the show &#x201C;Pawn Stars&#x201D;, in which their customers bring in antiquities for appraisal, and the items are then used to educate the audience with historical anecdotes and facts. &#x201C;Old Man&#x201D; Harrison became a bit of a celebrity when &#x201C;Pawn Stars&#x201D; became a hit, and the show is still in production. He was known to fans for his acerbic personality and love of classic cars.&amp;nbsp;
	
	&lt;br&gt;
	
	&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Orange County&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
	
	(DEVELOPMENT) &#x2014; A section of Perry Creek Drive in Chapel Hill will be closed by the town in order to address the structural deterioration of one of its bridges. 
	
	The portion that will be blocked from traffic includes the stretch between Pebble Springs Road and 201 Perry Creek Drive, and vehicles will be redirected starting at 12 PM Tuesday, June 26. Construction might last up to six months. Residents who live north of the closure will be encouraged to take an established Silver Creek Trail detour to access Weaver Dairy Road for their daily commute.
	
	The road, which runs parallel to Weaver Dairy Road, is located in the neighborhood of East Chapel Hill High School.
	
	The closure was preceded by a regular scheduled biennial inspection, conducted by a third-party engineering firm that examined &#x201C;the structural integrity of a large drainage culvert,&#x201D; according to a press release posted on the Town of Chapel Hill website. The statement went on to say, &#x201C;the Town is working to expedite the construction as much as possible.&#x201D;&amp;nbsp;
	
	&lt;br&gt;
	
	(UNIVERSITY) &#x2014; The U.S. Department of Education&#x2019;s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) found after a five-year investigation that &#x201C;UNC has failed to adopt and publish grievance procedures that provide for the prompt and equitable resolution of student, employee, and third-party complaints alleging discrimination on the basis of sex, as required by Title IX.&#x201D;
	
	OCR stated this in a &lt;a href="https://www.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/FINAL-R-LOF-UNC-Chapel-Hill-11132051-PDF.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Letter of Findings&lt;/a&gt; emailed to four former UNC-Chapel Hill students and a former UNC administrator on June 25. Those five filed a complaint about the system in January of 2013, and began the investigation as well as brought national attention to campus culture and sexual assault.
	
	The investigation used 387 cases of sexual misconduct between 2011 and 2016 to examine the policies and procedures used by UNC administrators and officials following sexual assault or harassment charges. OCR found the school to be in direct violation of Title IX antidiscrimination laws. It also stated that many UNC staff members were improperly or insufficiently trained in the implementation of the procedures that were in place, especially between the years 2011&#x2013;2013. The investigation found that cases filed between 2014 and 2016, which was after an internal policy revision, were addressed in a more &#x201C;reliable&#x201D; manner. The email also pointed out that &#x201C;the University's inadequate record-keeping made it difficult to determine the extent of any noncompliance during this period."
	
	UNC-Chapel Hill signed a &lt;a href="https://www.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/resolutionagreement.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;resolution agreement&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday, June 21 in which it admitted no violation of law, but committed to five action items to improve campus procedures.&amp;nbsp;
	
	&lt;br&gt;
	
	&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Durham&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
	
	(INVESTIGATION) &#x2014;The Durham Police Department continues to look into the April 18 death of developer William &#x201C;Bill&#x201D; Bishop, and have filed court documents this past week indicating that their investigation has been focused on the alleged involvement of Bishop&#x2019;s 16 year-old son, with a potential financial motive being speculated.
	
	Police are claiming that a purchase order for nearly $500,000 worth of gold was found on the property, although the gold itself has not yet been discovered. That piece of evidence, along with the teen&#x2019;s alleged internet search history, has kept law enforcement attention on his suspected role in the passing of his father. The documents read, in part, &#x201C;The searches and websites found in the web history included but are not limited to financial information, how to calculate the value of an estate, the value of the price of gold per ounce, and how to transfer bank accounts after death.&#x201D;
	
	Before his death, Bishop was a principal investor with the real estate investment firm Development Planning and Finance Group, which he joined in 2014. </body>

    <body>News and notes from the Piedmont and Triangle.
	
	&lt;b&gt;State News&lt;/b&gt;
	
	(SCIENCE) &#x2014; A flurry of speculation swirls among North Carolina&#x2019;s scientific community regarding a &#x201C;sonar anomaly&#x201D; discovered by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration off the coast of North Carolina. Questions and theories about the phenomenon have lit up online message boards and university classrooms.  
	
	NOAA announced Tuesday that a team of divers using underwater recording equipment would spend the day exploring a patch of ocean bed in an undisclosed location to identify the source of the anomaly, stating via the agency&#x2019;s &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/oceanexplorer/status/1011962823428145152" target="_blank"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; account that it &#x201C;could potentially be a shipwreck...an archaeology site, a geological formation, or otherwise!&#x201D;  NOAA did not issue a press release as of June 29, and attempts by the Sundial to speak with an NOAA representative on the record have been unsuccessful.
	
	The federal agency launched its &#x201C;Windows to the Deep 2018: Exploration of the Southeast U.S. Continental Margin&#x201D; expedition in early May to map currently uncharted undersea territory off the coasts of Georgia, Florida and South Carolina, as well as &#x201C;submarine canyons offshore of North Carolina.&#x201D;&amp;nbsp;
	
	While the NOAA is keeping quiet as to the exact GPS coordinates of the anomaly, the Outer Banks have long been referred to as &#x201C;The Graveyard of the Atlantic,&#x201D; due to the historically large number of vessels that sank in the surrounding waters. The NOAA is expected to publish its findings after its analysis is complete.
	
	&lt;br&gt;
	
	(CRIME) &#x2014; Governor Roy Cooper spoke to a crowd of over 100 police officers and courtroom staffers gathered at Guilford Courthouse National Military Park in Greensboro as part of a ceremonial kickoff for &#x201C;Operation Firecracker,&#x201D; a law enforcement initiative aimed at reducing drunk driving fatalities.
	
	 The program will include public education on the dangers of intoxication, extended training for officers patrolling highways and city roads, and an increased number of checkpoints in some high traffic areas throughout each county in the state. Cooper told the audience about his determination to curb the number of serious accidents and pointed to the 135 DWI-related deaths that have already occurred in North Carolina in 2018.
	
	 "That's 135 shattered families and communities that are broken... When you drink, when you do drugs and when you drive, you can shatter lives," Governor Cooper said. 
	
	Winston-Salem Police Chief Catrina Thompson and Mark Ezzell, director of the Governor&#x2019;s Highway Safety Program, also spoke at the event.
	
	Operation Firecracker will be in effect through July 8, and was scheduled to coincide with the July 4 holiday, when alcohol-related auto wrecks are known to spike. 
	
	&lt;br&gt;
	
	&lt;b&gt;Durham&lt;/b&gt;
	
	(HEALTH) &#x2014; Durham&#x2019;s first reported case in 2018 of rabies, a contagious and deadly disease that can spread from animals to humans, occurred this week, according to county health officials. 
	
	The announcement came on June 28 shortly after animal control workers were dispatched to a neighborhood near the intersection of West Club Boulevard and I-85 to capture a symptomatic fox sighted in a resident&#x2019;s backyard.
	
	According to the press release posted on the Durham County website at 11 AM on Thursday, &#x201C;two dogs have had interaction with the fox but no known human contact has been identified.&#x201D; The house pets were not seen in physical contact with the fox but were immediately revaccinated and are currently under a 45-day mandatory home observation.
	
	&#x201C;In animals, common symptoms of rabies may include decreased energy and appetite, and vomiting,&#x201D; the county&#x2019;s statement continued. 
	
	Sightings of foxes during daylight hours should also be considered a possible sign of infection and reported, since both species of fox found in the Piedmont are normally nocturnal. In humans, a rabies infection is highly treatable if the vaccination is administered prior to the first sign of illness, which usually appears between three and eight weeks after exposure. The mortality rate for untreated rabies in humans is nearly 100 percent.&amp;nbsp;
	
	Any Durham resident who suspects that a local animal may be infected should contact Durham County Animal Services at 919-560-0900.

	The new building at the end of Shelton Street, across North Greensboro Street just a block or two from downtown Carrboro, will house the first Dingo Dog tap room.&amp;nbsp;
	
	The brewery already distributes its beer to 14 bars and restaurants in the area, including Beer Study, The Kraken and Imbibe in Chapel Hill, 2nd Wind in Carrboro, The Eddy Pub &amp;amp; Restaurant in Saxapahaw, The City Tap in Pittsboro and Growler Grlz in Durham.&lt;br&gt;
	
	 But the origins of Dingo Dog Brewing Company go back to Mississippi, where a family that loved animals came head to head with Hurricane Katrina.
	
	Partners Tim Schwarzauer and Billy Gagon, brewer, joined forces when Schwarzauer moved to North Carolina from Jackson, Mississippi, after the two enjoyed brewing together as a hobby.
	
	Schwarzauer grew up in Mississippi with a family that was always rescuing animals. &#x201C;It was mainly cats growing up,&#x201D; said Schwarzauer. But it was not until he was in college and Hurricane Katrina hit the east coast that the family stepped up to animal rescue on a larger scale.
	
	&#x201C;We started rescuing animals off the coast of Mississippi," said Schwarzauer. &#x201C;We were pulling dogs, cats and even a couple of parakeets out of the overcrowded shelters. Others were just strays brought back by national groups to Jackson.
	
	&#x201C;The national groups eventually moved out and 40 to 50 animals remained, and that is when my family and I started our nonprofit, no-kill shelter," said Schwarzauer. "It wasn't easy, but nothing about shelter work is."
	
	 By the time Schwarzauer moved to North Carolina, the family-run shelter was caring for, on average, 250 dogs and 100 to 150 cats.
	
	 
	
	Then, when Schwarzauer and self-proclaimed cat lover Billy Gagon  started brewing together, the two decided to start a nonprofit brewing company that gave all proceeds to the benefit of animals in the surrounding area.
	
	"Everything after our operation costs go to the charity," said Schwarzauer. "The grants are open to anyone in the state that is with a no-kill shelter, [an] animal rescue organization, spay-and-neuter voucher programs or vets or clinics that want to work with us on voucher programs."
	
	They currently partner with groups like Paws4Ever in Orange County.
	
	Paws4Ever staff member Emily Albert describes it as "a placement partner for animals transferred from six county shelters...Wake, Orange, Durham, Chatham, Burlington and Caswell County."
	
	Because they do not euthanize for space, Paw4Ever provides their animals with 50 acres of beautiful environment with indoor-outdoor kennels and walking trails for them to use with volunteers as they wait to be adopted.
	
	"Dingo Dog Brewing Company does several things for us throughout the year," said Albert. "They do what they call &#x2018;Tap-Takeover&#x2019; where they go into a local bar and serve for the night with us or our info there and a portion of the proceeds goes to our program.
	
	"We also have a PawsFest walk in the fall in Southern Village, and they sell beer at the event and all sales goes to our program. It is a really great event and they are always such wonderful guys."
	
	The company also partners with The Goathouse Refuge, a nonprofit, no-kill and cage-free sanctuary in Pittsboro primarily for cats, and Beyond Fences, a Durham charity providing assistance to low-income pet owners to spay, neuter, vaccinate, and fence, rather than chain, their dogs. 
	
	The Dingo Dog Brewery itself is located on Plowgirl Farm on NC-54, near the bar The Kraken.
	
	"Here, we brew the beer and cider," said Schwartauer as he stood on-site. "We are actually a brewery and winery."
	
	Ever since they opened, creativity has been part of their blossoming operation. Sally Joe Slusher, who owns Plowgirl Farms, is part of that.
	
	"I formulate most of the recipes,&#x201D; said Gagon. "And since we are on a working farm and she [Slusher] has extra produce, we have beer with ingredients like sweet potatoes, tomatoes, ginger and butternut. You never know what we might do next."
	
	Whatever they invent, it will be available at the new taproom. According to Gagon, "We are aiming to open by the end of the summer."</body>

    <title>Carrboro Apartment Standoff Ends Without Gunshots</title>
    <subhead></subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>CARRBORO &#x2014; An armed standoff that closed down an apartment complex for more than three hours Friday afternoon ended without gunfire when a man surrendered himself to police negotiators.
	
	At around 2 PM, The Carrboro Police Department responded to the Berkshire 54 apartments off NC Highway 54 after a 911 call that warned of a possibly armed &#x201C;suicidal subject&#x201D;  in one of the units. Before police arrived, the subject had barricaded himself in. 
	
	Interagency response to the situation inside involved members of Chapel Hill Police and Orange County Sheriff&#x2019;s departments. Carrboro police managed the response, some officers being equipped with SWAT weaponry and defensive equipment.
	
	Snipers were positioned beneath bushes approximately 200 yards from Building T, where the subject sat with blinds closed and made sporadic contact with police and friends.
	
	The man told friends and Sundial personnel that he was neither suicidal nor ready to commit violence, and not holding the firearm, adding that police did not have a warrant to enter the apartment and that he wished to be left alone. 
	
	A young woman who had resided in the Building T apartment with the man and been in a romantic relationship with him waited anxiously with officers outside the pool clubhouse, the temporary command post. She had left the apartment of her own volition before the police arrived.
	
	The woman told Sundial personnel that the man had been using a gun to play games similar to Russian roulette late the night before.&amp;nbsp;
	
	She had not called the police, but had contacted a friend about the man&#x2019;s potentially suicidal behavior, who in turn alerted authorities. According to Carrboro police, the call prompting their response came from Franklin Street&#x2019;s Chapel Hill Florist.&lt;br&gt;
	
	The man was, according to the woman, in possession of a weapon. Based on descriptions, the weapon may have been Taurus 513 Raging Judge pistol, a 45/410-magnum, 6.5-inch barrel-length sidearm with six-bullet capacity.
	
	After arrival, police set up a base of operations in the Berkshire 54 clubhouse, using the exercise room and an area near the complex&#x2019;s swimming pool as a command center.
	
	&#x201C;Our concern is, he holds all the cards right now,&#x201D; said an officer to the subject&#x2019;s friend as the situation languished in 95-degree heat, after officers had changed shifts.
	
	Around that time, Orange County EMS workers arrived with an ambulance. The man was still inside the apartment, and officers had set up in protective positions around the parking lot with guns trained upon the man&#x2019;s apartment.
	
	Law enforcement members exhibited patience and discretion as they extracted the man safely from the apartment, responding to the messages he was sending from the apartment and eventually reaching an agreement.
	
	The man agreed to meet with officers at around 6 PM, voluntarily placing himself into custody. He was cuffed by 6:15 PM and walked out of the building accompanied by negotiators, his attorney, and members of a tactical team who carried SWAT weaponry and equipment.
	
	Access to and from Berkshire 54 apartments was restored to the complex&#x2019;s residents shortly thereafter.
	
	The young woman and the man were permitted to speak together through the rear passenger side window of a patrol car for a few moments before he was taken to UNC Hospital for evaluation. 
	
	A replica sidearm similar to a Taurus Raging Judge was found broken down inside the apartment after the stand-down. Details on what police took into evidence, including whether that evidence included an operational pistol, are unknown.
	
	The man had not been arrested or charged with a crime as of Friday. It is not known whether a warrant or criminal charges are pending for the man, who was at UNC Hospital on Friday night.</body>

    <body>News and notes from the Piedmont and Triangle.
	
	&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Raleigh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
	
	(OBITUARY) &#x2014; Among the five journalists whose lives were cut short by a gunman who opened fire in the offices of the Capital Gazette newspaper in Annapolis, Maryland, was former Raleigh news radio reporter Rob Hiaasen. He was employed by the Gazette as an assistant editor since 2010.
	
	The alleged gunman has a history of suing and criticizing the paper. He is now in custody.
	
	A native of South Florida, Hiaasen was the brother of well-known satirical novelist and Miami Herald columnist Carl Hiaasen. Rob Hiaasen left Miami in 1984 to join the staff of WPTF News Radio 680 in Raleigh, where he covered high-profile political campaigns, the criminal justice system and intense human- interest stories. Colleagues praised his ability to cultivate an expertise in both radio and print journalism.  
	
	He met Maria Mills at the radio station and the two were married after a five-month courtship.
	
	Hiaasen is survived by his widow and their three children, Ben, Samantha and Hannah.
	
	&lt;br&gt;
	
	(BUSINESS) &#x2014; This past March, one-time retail giant Toys &#x201C;R&#x201D; Us, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in late 2017, began liquidating assets across the country in anticipation of their permanent closure at the end of business on Friday, June 29.
	
	The liquidation process included massive discounts of up to 80 percent on certain products. However, Triangle residents who attempted to take advantage of the unprecedented markdowns arrived at the Raleigh location Friday morning only to find the front doors locked and a silhouette of barren shelves inside. Frustrated customers discovered that, as reported by media outlets, that an anonymous philanthropist spent upwards of $1 million purchasing the store&#x2019;s remaining inventory, with the rumored intention of donating the toys to underprivileged children this upcoming holiday season.            
	
	No Toys &#x201C;R&#x201D; Us stores in the United States will survive the bankruptcy, although the brand will to continue to operate in parts of Europe and Australia. 
	
	Job loss expected as a result of the closures is estimated at 31,000 nationally.
	
	&lt;br&gt;
	
	&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Durham&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
	
	(CRIME) &#x2014; Durham teenager Jaewon Curtis will was sentenced to more than a decade in state prison for his role in the shooting death of taxi driver Ameer Suliman in August of 2016. Curtis pled guilty to second degree murder and robbery at a court appearance on Friday, June 29.
	
	Defense lawyer Brian Aus asked for leniency based on his client&#x2019;s age; Curtis was only 15 years old at the time of the incident. However, Assistant District Attorney Luke Bumm told the court, &#x201C;The conduct [Curtis] was engaging in was the conduct of an adult.&#x201D;
	
	Before his sentence was announced, Curtis had an opportunity to speak on his own behalf, and read aloud from a prepared apology directed at Suliman&#x2019;s widow.&amp;nbsp;
	
	"I guess you don't believe me, but I am truly sorry,&#x201D; Curtis said.
	
	In the end, Judge Orlando Hudson decided on an incarceration period of 12 to 15 years. Curtis&#x2019; alleged accomplice was also in the courtroom but did not enter a plea, and instead requested a new defense attorney.&amp;nbsp;
	
	&lt;br&gt;
	
	(CONTROVERSY) &#x2014; The Durham Performing Arts Center (DPAC) has come under recent criticism for scheduling a September lecture by psychologist, bestselling author and provocative speaker Jordan Peterson of the University of Toronto.
	
	Peterson was relatively unknown outside of the rarified circles of Canadian academics until he took a public stance against Canada&#x2019;s 2016 parliamentary Bill C-16, which added "gender identity or expression" as a prohibited ground of discrimination under the Canadian Human Rights Act. Peterson opposed the bill on the grounds of free speech and claimed the change in law would lead to the criminal status of anyone who misapplies gender pronouns (this analysis has been debated). Since then he has produced a series of YouTube videos on both psychology and identity, including a playlist titled &#x201C;Professor Against Political Correctness.&#x201D; 
	
	Laura Bullard of Durham&#x2019;s Indy Week published a blistering rebuke of Peterson, his writing and his policy prescriptions. It read, in part, &#x201C;The American South has historically been (and continues to be) a place where marginalized people are unsafe. It is [DPAC&#x2019;s] responsibility as a cultural hub of this region to be aware of that. It is our responsibility to hold you accountable when you invite people into our community who foment hate.&#x201D; The editorial went on to throw down a gauntlet of sorts, threatening to &#x201C;reconsider [DPAC] as an institution&#x201D; if Peterson&#x2019;s invitation is not rescinded. 
	
	Local protest against DPAC and Peterson has been growing rapidly on social media and community listservs since Bullard&#x2019;s article was posted online Thursday, June 28. </body>

	(COMMUNITY) &#x2014; Jeremie Dale Earp, a 36-year-old Wake County man, drowned at Zebulon&#x2019;s Little River Park on Sunday, July 2 after jumping into the river to save an eight-year-old boy who had accidentally fallen in.
	
	After Earp was able to get the child, Jackson Picarella, into the hands of someone on the shore, he slipped below the surface and did not reappear. Others nearby dove into the water in an attempt to rescue Earp, but were unsuccessful. Several minutes passed with no sighting of Earp at the surface. The rescuers continued to search the area until they found him and pulled him out. When EMS personnel arrived at the scene, they found witnesses administering CPR, which EMS then took over.
	
	Resuscitation efforts continued for approximately an hour before Earp was officially declared dead.

	(GOVERNMENT) &#x2014; An ad posted in Craigslist&#x2019;s community column about a week ago offered willing participants $50 each to attend a Cary Town Council meeting and publicly support an upcoming construction project.
	
	The ad read in part, "We need clean and well kept people who can act with composure... Your only task will be to ask a handful of questions that support the project." The ad called it "our construction project" but no poster has been identified. The post instructed anyone who might be interested to meet at a local fast food restaurant to coordinate the logistics.
	
	Cary Mayor Pro Tem Lori Bush went onto &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/loribush/status/1012519479845310464" target="_blank"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; on June 28, the day of the meeting spoken of, to express disapproval at the attempt to pack the hearing with paid advocates. "This does a huge disservice to our civically-minded, smart and passionate citizens who make Cary a better place by being engaged, forthright &amp;amp; honest w/feedback," she said. "I don't think that's the way our democracy was set up to work."
	
	The only construction project with a public hearing at the meeting was a high-rise hotel, the planners of which are seeking an exemption to zoning designation, building height restrictions and minimum widths of the surrounding streetscape. According to the &lt;a href="http://carycitizen.com/2018/07/02/craigslist-post-creates-cary-council-controversy/" target="_blank"&gt;Cary Citizen,&lt;/a&gt; the applicant's law team denied involvement and expressed suspicion that the post may have been meant to damage the application.</body>

	(INVESTIGATION) &#x2014; A man&#x2019;s body was found partly decomposed near Interstate 85 and NC-86.
	
	The Orange County Sheriff&#x2019;s Office was dispatched to a forested area along highway NC-86 on Tuesday, July 3 after receiving a 911 call that a decomposing body had been spotted earlier that afternoon.
	
	Initial reports from Sheriff Charles Blackwood indicated that the body was a male, and that identification might take some time, as no photo ID was found at the scene.
	
	The deceased was approximately 25 feet from the roadside and was obscured from view by foliage; the location is near an auto mechanic shop and a tractor supply company. Additional evidence, mostly beverage bottles and other refuse, suggested that the person may have spent an extended amount of time at the site. 
	
	The Orange County Medical Examiner told media outlets on Thursday, July 5, that the body was positively identified as 51-year-old Darrell Wayne Staley, a Hillsborough resident, and that family members were contacted by authorities for confirmation. The cause of death is still unknown. Sheriff&#x2019;s deputies and investigators who processed the scene do not suspect foul play.

	(COLLISION) &#x2014; An automobile accident involving a Buick Enclave that was reported stolen and a Ford Focus left one person dead and three people injured on Thursday, July 5. The wreck occurred around 11:30 PM after the driver of the silver Ford reportedly swerved into the left lane of Duke Street, near the Durham School of the Arts. With both vehicles heading northbound, the Ford struck the Buick, causing it to hit a nearby utility pole. This caused the side door of the Ford to be pushed into a tree before coming to stop.
	
	Both the man at the wheel of the Ford and his 25-year-old passenger were rushed to the hospital, and the driver of the Ford was pronounced dead shortly afterward. The passenger was also injured, but is expected to recover.
	
	The female driver of the Buick, who has not yet been identified, also sustained serious injuries and was last reported to be in stable condition. Her 14-year-old male passenger was also brought to the hospital with minor injuries.
	
	In the course of investigating the accident, police discovered that the Buick had been reported stolen by its owner on Tuesday, July 3.
	
	It is unclear at this time if alcohol or drugs were involved in the accident, and detectives were awaiting the results of toxicology screens.

	(GARDEN) &#x2014; The Plants Delights Nursery at Raleigh&#x2019;s Juniper Level Botanic Garden reported on the afternoon of Friday, June 7 that its home-grown Amorphophallus titanum, better known by its common name the &#x201C;corpse flower,&#x201D; is in full bloom, a phenomenon which is relatively rare for the species when bred in captivity.
	
	The macabre name was derived from the distinctive odor it emits when flowering, often compared to that of a rotting animal carcass, which it evolved over eons to attract scavenging insects as pollinators. An Italian botanist named Odoardo Beccari first classified the Amorphophallus titanum during an 1878 expedition to Indonesia; it was first successfully grown outside its native habitat in 1889. Generally speaking, when cultivated in a controlled environment, the corpse flower takes between seven and 10 years of consistent growth before its first bloom period occurs, after which the bloom cycle varies considerably between individual specimens.
	
	Nursery employees expect the flower to remain open and pungent for approximately 30 to 48 hours, with initial wilting to begin after the first 24 hours.

    <title>Hornets Are Hot in Las Vegas Summer Showcase</title>
    <subhead></subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>&lt;i&gt;Update: The Charlotte Hornets beat the Miami Heat in Sunday's summer league game 94-90. The Hornets are 2-0 in Las Vegas Summer League play.&lt;/i&gt;
	
	NORTH CAROLINA &#x2014; Though the NBA season is still months away, there is plenty of Charlotte Hornets basketball to be played in July. With the NBA summer league in full swing, fans can watch as they contemplate Charlotte&#x2019;s prospects in the 2018-2019 season.
	
	Charlotte is 1-0 in the Las Vegas Summer League, having defeated the defending NBA champion Oklahoma City Thunder, 88-87, on Friday. The NBA reported on Saturday that guard Malik Monk broke his thumb during the game and will be out from six to eight weeks recovering, marking the end of summer basketball for the 20-year-old hopeful from the University of Kentucky. 
	
	No sooner did the trade of Dwight Howard to the Nets for Timofey Mozgov become official on Friday than the Hornets traded Mosgov in a three-team deal that returned 6&#x2019;9&#x201D; center Bismack Biyombo to the team (Biyombo played for the Bobcats/Hornets from 2011-2015). 
	
	The Nets bought out Howard&#x2019;s contract and the Washington Wizards will reportedly be signing Howard for $5.3 million. 
	
	Meanwhile, the Hornets have signed Tony Parker, a six-time All-Star, four-time league champion, and 17-year point guard, to a two-year $10 million deal on Friday.
	
	Parker&#x2019;s starting days in the NBA are mostly finished. His minutes started to slip during his past couple of seasons in the San Antonio Spurs organization, but the Hornets are betting that Parker can still be a decent backup at age 36, behind Kemba Walker. 
	
	Devont&#xE9; Graham, a rookie point guard on the Hornets roster, was a consensus first-team All American and Big 12 player of the year last season. Although he will more than likely be third-string behind these two, he will get to learn behind two All-Stars in Walker and Parker. 
	
	Graham could hardly ask for better point guards to develop under or learn how to be a great NBA player in all aspects. Walker also won the NBA Sportsmanship award the past two seasons in addition to being named an All-Star in both of those seasons.
	
	The Hornets&#x2019; win over Oklahoma City was their first Summer League game. Charlotte&#x2019;s starting lineup against the  Thunder was composed of young talents Graham, Malik Monk, Dwayne Bacon, Miles Bridges and Willy Hernangomez.
	
	With one of the most solid starting lineups in the summer league, the Hornets  tied for second in bookmakers&#x2019; odds to win it.
	
	Monk, a natural shooting guard who also possesses the skills to be a point guard, started off blazing hot on Friday. After the Hornets scored the game&#x2019;s first two points on free throws, Monk scored the next 11. With the Hornets up 13-8,  Oklahoma City called a timeout to try to cool him down. Monk finished the first quarter hitting a three-pointer at the buzzer, ending the quarter with 15 points. Monk finished the game as Charlotte&#x2019;s leading scorer with 23 and notched two assists, two steals and a rebound. Malik shot 56 percent from the field for the game, probably his most impressive stat.
	
	Hernangomez finished with 16 points and 14 rebounds. Miles Bridges, the 12th overall pick in this year&#x2019;s draft, had a disappointing shooting percentage for the game, though he did finish with 10 rebounds and a couple of assists to go with his six points and two blocks in 27 minutes.
	
	Bridges had an explosive alley-oop dunk and displayed a lot of energy on the defensive end. Graham finished with 10 points on 40 percent shooting and five assists, along with a steal and four rebounds. 
	
	Another notable performance came from the rookie drafted from Lithuania, Arnoldas Kubolka, who finished with 12 points on 57 percent shooting from the field with an assist and a steal. He will most likely continue playing overseas for the next season or two, but the Hornets will keep him in their back pocket for the future.
	
	The Hornets kept the game close throughout, despite finishing with 17 turnovers. OKC finished the game with their 20th turnover in the last second, sealing the deal for the Hornets, 88-87.
	
	Though very close throughout, the game featured sloppy play, and fans should hope that it wasn&#x2019;t a precursor to how the season will look for Charlotte.  </body>

	&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;NC Mission Trip Members Stuck in Port-au-Prince During Destructive Protests&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
	
	(RELIGION) &#x2014; Twelve members of Stanly County&#x2019;s North Albemarle Baptist Church were scheduled to return from a mission trip to Haiti on Friday, July 6 when civil unrest broke out near the Port-au-Prince airport, forcing the group to take shelter in a local orphanage. 
	
	Protestors in the capital city were reportedly responding to a dramatic rise in gas prices that were scheduled to take effect Saturday, July 7. The government, led by Prime Minister Jack Guy Lafontant, had planned to increase petroleum prices by 38 percent, with kerosene and diesel prices nearly doubling from their current levels. This was to align with strict guidelines included in a national assistance package by the International Monetary Fund.
	
	President Jovenel Mo&#xEF;se and Lafontant rescinded the increase on Saturday evening and asked residents to leave the streets and return home, although their plea appears to have had little effect on the violence.
	
	Al-Jazeera English is reporting that at least two deaths have occurred since the rioting began, and that multiple businesses were looted and burned in the chaos.  
	
	The United States Embassy in Haiti sent out a message on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/USEmbassyHaiti/status/1016339948146847745" target="_blank"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; at 8:15 AM on Monday, July 9 stating, &#x201C;The Embassy is aware flights are arriving to Port-au-Prince&#x2019;s international airport. We continue to advise U.S. citizens to shelter in place at this time.&#x201D;
	
	The North Albemarle Baptist Church group, which includes two minors, tried again to schedule a flight out of the country on Sunday, July 8 after commercial carriers resumed flights, but were thwarted by barricades and impromptu checkpoints at which foreigners were coerced to pay unofficial tolls in order to reach the terminal.    
	
	North Albemarle Baptist Reverend Brad Lynch, who is part of the stranded group, told the Charlotte Observer that the church has booked the dozen mission workers a 9 AM flight for Wednesday, July 10, but that if they are unable to take it, the situation could turn dire, as food and supplies are running short. The Observer also reported that the church has tried unsuccessfully to wire money to their marooned congregants.  
	
	American mission workers from South Carolina, Georgia and Florida are also stuck in or near the city while they wait for the situation to stabilize.&amp;nbsp;
	
	&lt;br&gt;
	
	&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Wilson Residents Struck by Paintball War&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
	
	(POLICE) &#x2014; The Wilson Police Department has made five arrests in connection with what some officials have termed a &#x201C;paintball war&#x201D; being waged by local youth possibly as part of a national urban movement that has started to trade traditional firearms for paintball gear. 
	
	The &#x201C;war&#x201D; began on the afternoon of July 1 when a woman riding her bicycle on Nash Street in Wilson was struck in the back with a paintball. About an hour later, a man named Joe Uditis was shot on the arm with a similar projectile while tending to chores in his yard. Later that same afternoon, an empty vehicle parked in front of a house in the 800 block of Goldsboro Street was also shot.
	
	Investigations into the day&#x2019;s incidents led to three young men being booked on charges of simple assault and the illegal discharge of firearms within the city limits. 
	
	Then, in the midst of July 4 holiday celebrations, an officer on patrol responded to a traffic accident at the corner of Trinity Drive and Ward Boulevard. According to a police department press release, &#x201C;The officer spoke to Dion Horne, who stated that unknown subjects shot his residence with paintball guns as they were driving by. Horne pursued the suspects on his vehicle until the suspect vehicle struck a light pole. Horne stated that the driver was injured and couldn&#x2019;t run, but three other suspects fled on foot.&#x201D; Two arrests were made shortly afterward.
	
	Police spokesman Sgt. Stephen Stroud told Wilson news outlets that detectives have found evidence on social media of some individuals having openly bragged about committing paintball &#x201C;drive-bys&#x201D; in the city. 
	
	In early April, the Durham Police Department posted on the neighborhood listserv website Nextdoor, asking parents to help them deal with a similar situation after 14 separate paintball attacks were reported. Officers explained that it would be easy for authorities to mistake a paintball gun for a real firearm, possibly leading to confrontations and serious injuries.  
	
	The now-national movement of &#x201C;Paintballs up, Guns Down&#x201D; was begun on social media by Shayaa Bin Abraham-Joseph, a rapper known as 21 Savage, in March. By May, the trend of urban paintball fights was noticeably high. On May 9, Vice News published on &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmoKt348tY8" target="_blank"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; the video &#x201C;Detroiters Are Waging Paintball Wars As A Way To Stop Gang Violence (HBO)&#x201D; showing interviews with residents describing a &#x201C;paintball movement&#x201D; that was &#x201C;bringing people together&#x201D; even as they spray each other with paintballs. Some authorities have called the movement misguided, damaging to property, and dangerous to targets, bystanders and, indirectly, shooters whose weapons may be mistaken for real firearms by police.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;</body>

    <title>New Internet Law Yanks 'Oldest Profession' Back to Streets</title>
    <subhead></subhead>
    <subheadTwo>Fed shutdown of sites like Backpage could push the sex trade onto streets and out of sight</subheadTwo>
    <body>NORTH CAROLINA &#x2014; New federal legislation has disrupted the illegal sex trade in North Carolina, that which occurs between consenting adults as well as trafficking that exploits the vulnerable and forces entry into sex work.&lt;br&gt;
	
	Regulations intended to prevent trafficking could have the effect of forcing such activity deeper underground, some experts and sex workers say.&amp;nbsp;
	
	U.S. Rep. Mark Walker of North Carolina&#x2019;s 6th District cosponsored the bill that President Donald Trump signed into law on April 11, which pushes for the shutdown of Internet sites where sex for money is advertised.&amp;nbsp;
	
	This resulted in the federal shutdown of Backpage.com, a personals forum used by many sex workers to connect with solicitors &#x2014; and, feds say, as a vehicle for the exploitation of minors and others pressed into sex work.
	
	Sex workers in North Carolina, including a woman interviewed by the Sundial who advertises &#x201C;escort services,&#x201D; used Backpage to advertise.
	
	All states but Nevada outlaw prostitution, and state and federal laws prohibit the exploitation of minors and nonconsenting adults in the commercialization of sex. In North Carolina lawbooks, prostitution and solicitation are categorized as Class One misdemeanors. North Carolina Judges may consider specific circumstances in meting out punishment, and state law prevents a jail sentence exceeding 120 days if convicted.
	
	Despite laws, a market for sex persists. Data on the number of current working escorts in North Carolina is hard to come by, but FBI statistics show a significant drop in state arrests for prostitution between 2001 and 2016, from 1,566 to 182 people. It is possible that the downturn in arrests reflects the industry&#x2019;s move to cyberspace. It could also represent shifting priorities among local law enforcement departments.
	
	&lt;br&gt;
	
	&lt;b&gt;Real Work&lt;/b&gt;
	
	According to anti-trafficking advocacy group Project No Rest, North Carolina remains in the top 10 states for most human trafficking. Trafficking victims are defined as those underage and/or coerced or deceived into prostitution.
	
	North Carolina and the Triangle have a population of sex workers also: people of legal age who consent to exchange sex for money, distinct from trafficking victims.
	
	An Orange County law enforcement professional who did not wish to be named states that online escorts tend to concentrate in sections of Raleigh and around RDU airport because there are more motels and hotels in which to conduct business.&amp;nbsp;
	
	The western Triangle sees fewer activity because &#x201C;there are only a couple of hotels in Chapel Hill [and] Carrboro, and the risk of [clients] being spotted is high.&#x201D;&amp;nbsp;
	
	The Sundial spoke with a woman who has made her living as an escort in Raleigh for the past five years, who said sites like Backpage allowed women to pursue sex work independent of some aspects of the business
	
	&amp;nbsp;&#x201C;I&#x2019;m independent, so I don&#x2019;t do pimps or services,&#x201D; said the woman, who advertises as Carmen. She said it was her impression that Backpage offered girls a way to work for themselves &#x201C;because of the large amount of traffic&#x201D; that the site generated.&amp;nbsp;
	
	When news of the shutdown hit the streets, she said, &#x201C;All the hoes panicked, because that is how we pay our bills. [Not] everyone is&#x2026;on drugs. Some do it to pay for college and many of us have families to feed.&#x201D;
	
	Carmen herself is a graduate of North Carolina Central University, where she majored in psychology. &#x201C;I also had a corporate job but still make more money [escorting] tax free... I love what I do, in other words.&#x201D;&amp;nbsp;
	
	&lt;br&gt;
	
	&lt;b&gt;Exploitation&lt;/b&gt;
	
	The Sundial spoke by phone to Charlene Reese, a representative for the Durham Crisis Response Center. Reese criticized a dearth of local media coverage on trafficking. &#x201C;When I tell people I work in human trafficking services and they say, &#x2018;Oh, that&#x2019;s not happening in Durham,&#x2019;&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;They don&#x2019;t realize that it is happening here to young people in our community.&#x201D;
	
	Victims of trafficking are her focus, but Reece also works with women who entered the profession by choice. She disputes the notion that independent escorts such as Carmen aren&#x2019;t being misused too.&amp;nbsp;
	
	&#x201C;There are probably some women who say [they aren&#x2019;t being exploited]&#x2026;and choose to do sex work because they feel fulfilled,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;But for probably most people who are doing sex work, they are doing it because it is the best option for them because other options are limited.&#x201D;&amp;nbsp;
	
	Does that make them trafficking victims? No, Reese said, but that does not turn sex work into a legitimate option.&amp;nbsp;
	
	&#x201C;If you have limited education, or you have a criminal record, and you have a child or two that needs to eat and you know that the only way you can get money is to sell yourself, then you can choose to do that,&#x201D; said Reese. &#x201C;And then you are not being trafficked, you are choosing to do that. But are you doing it because you are fulfilled or because it&#x2019;s the only choice you have?&#x201D;
	
	&lt;br&gt;
	
	&lt;b&gt;A Safe Space?&lt;/b&gt;
	
	Clinical sexologist Laurie Bennett-Cook, who studied at the Institute for Advanced Study of Human Sexuality in San Francisco, delineated between sex work and sex trafficking, or the exploitation of people by forcing them into sex work.&amp;nbsp;
	
	Bennett-Cook spoke by email. Backpage may have been a place for both trafficking victims and sex workers, but she emphasizes the difference, and the impacts upon each of the recent move by the government to shut down the site.
	
	&#x201C;Trafficking and voluntary sex work are quite different from one another; lumping them together does a disservice to actually ending sex trafficking,&#x201D; Bennett-Cook said. &#x201C;Making sex work a crime does not help people get out of it any more than decriminalizing sex work traps people in it. At its core, sex work is a transaction between consenting adults &#x2014; an agreed payment for an agreed service.&#x201D;&amp;nbsp;
	
	She emphasized that not all women engaged in prostitution are doing so as a last resort. &#x201C;There are many people who choose this line of work who are educated, not abused, not addicts, who do this work because they enjoy it and believe themselves to be offering a much-needed service,&#x201D; she said.
	
	Economist and associate professor Scott Cunningham of Baylor University recognizes prostitution as the single most dangerous vocation for a woman in the United States, citing a 2004 study by John Potterat and other scholars that found the profession&#x2019;s homicide rate to be 204 per 100,000 people in the United States. The gross female homicide rate was 2.2 per 100,000 in 2015, according to the CDC.
	
	A 2017 study co-authored by Cunningham found that in the years between 2002 and 2010, whenever Craigslist made their erotic services section available to a new city, the female homicide rate there dropped by an average of 17.4 percent. In summarizing their findings, Cunningham and his colleagues John Tripp and Gregory DeAngelo stated, &#x201C;Our analysis suggests that this reduction in female violence was the result of street prostitutes moving indoors and matching more efficiently with safer clients.&#x201D;
	
	Cunningham, who spoke with the Sundial by phone, said that in his opinion, &#x201C;The government isn&#x2019;t providing the right incentives to these companies [such as Backpage and Craigslist] to report trafficking.&#x201D;
	
	&lt;br&gt;
	
	&lt;b&gt;Shuttering Backpage&lt;/b&gt;
	
	The bill Rep. Walker sponsored was part of a broader federal attempt to curb the trafficking and coercion of vulnerable populations into the illegal sex trade.&amp;nbsp;
	
	The law amends the Communications Decency Act of 1996 and is the combination of two bills: the Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act (FOSTA) in the U.S. House of Representatives, and the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act (SESTA) in the Senate. The package of both passed with broad majorities of 388-25 and 92-2 in House and Senate respectively.&amp;nbsp;
	
	Until recently, Backpage was a popular destination for those looking to buy and sell sex in its many derivations. Section 230 of CDA was commonly claimed to prevent website operators from being held liable for what other people posted on their site.
	
	Backpage.com was a subsidiary of Dutch conglomerate Atlantische Bedrijven CV. Feds seized Backpage&#x2019;s domain name in April.&amp;nbsp;
	
	Prior to that, numerous American lawsuits accused Backpage of willfully ignoring the trafficking of underage girls. The Netflix documentary &#x201C;I Am Jane Doe&#x201D; featured extensive interviews with sexually exploited young people that also implicated Backpage.&amp;nbsp;
	
	In 2016, Texas state authorities raided Backpage&#x2019;s corporate headquarters and arrested CEO Carl Ferrer. Ferrer eventually pled guilty to conspiracy to facilitate prostitution as well as money laundering. He did not admit to pimping or sex trafficking.
	
	&amp;nbsp;
	
	&lt;b&gt;The &#x201C;Flash Press&#x201D;&lt;/b&gt;
	
	The Backpage advertising model came from the free alternative weekly newspapers that sprouted up in cities during the 1970s and &#x2018;80s, who subsidized their youth-targeted reporting with classified and personal ads. These ad sections soon came to be dominated by individuals offering sex in the guise of &#x201C;escorting&#x201D; or romantic connections, and the more numerous they became, the less willing traditional advertisers were to purchase copy space alongside them, thus generating more space for such ads.
	
	A history of government action to regulate printed advertisements for sex predates Internet days. In 1907, for instance, personals in the New York Herald were exposed by a rival Hearst newspaper for offering services that went a step beyond &#x201C;ladies as masseuses and as companions for elderly gentlemen&#x201D; (to quote former Hearst editor Jack McPhaul). Publisher James Gordon Bennett Jr. was convicted of sending obscene matter through the mails and fined $25,000.&#x201D;
	
	The Internet was a new frontier. Economist Scott Cunningham, an associate professor at Baylor University, said, &#x201C;When Craigslist first started its erotic services section it was free to post an ad.
	
	&#x201C;But, under pressure from state-level officials [most notably current New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, who was the state&#x2019;s attorney general at the time] and negative press coverage, they began charging five dollars. Then they were accused of making money off of prostitution.&#x201D;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
	
	Craigslist&#x2019;s &#x201C;erotic services&#x201D; section had been the go-to destination for online sex listings. But Craigslist discontinued the &#x201C;erotic services&#x201D; section in 2010. The gap was filled by Backpage.
	
	Feds seized the Backpage.com domain name on April 6, shutting down the website.
	
	While Backpage may have been the Web&#x2019;s most recognized classifieds page for sex solicitation during its eight years, in its absence there have emerged new websites for sex workers that look and function identically to their predecessor.
	
	Carmen said she makes use of these new sites, though it may take some time before the traffic volume reaches Backpage numbers. In that same time, they may be shut down. She does not worry about the dent in her income after Backpage&#x2019;s loss, and she made it clear that that she will not be looking for new clients offline.&amp;nbsp;
	
	&lt;br&gt;
	
	&lt;b&gt;&#x201C;Not an easy issue&#x201D;&lt;/b&gt;
	
	The Durham City Police Department&#x2019;s public affairs manager, Wil Glenn, affirmed that no homicides involving female victims in their jurisdiction were reported for two months after Backpage&#x2019;s shutdown.&amp;nbsp;
	
	When asked if the department has noticed a reduction in escort advertising within the same time period, he replied, &#x201C;Possibly, but it is hard to quantify in numbers because of the difficulties in enforcement prior to the shutdown.&#x201D;
	
	Glenn emphasized that illegal sex work &#x201C;is not an easy issue for law enforcement to solve. An operation has to be put together to catch one [online classified] poster. Even then, that helps to catch the person selling sex, but not a pimp that may be involved.&#x201D;&amp;nbsp;
	
	The police also understand that they may find victims of trafficking or other coercive situations. &#x201C;When we run into someone involved in sex work, the goal is not always criminal charges. Sometimes the goal is to get them connected to appropriate resources, such as Project FIGHT [Free Individuals Gripped by Human Trafficking] or the Durham Crisis Response Center.&#x201D;&amp;nbsp;
	
	&lt;br&gt;
	
	&lt;b&gt;Change of Venues&lt;/b&gt;
	
	The federal government&#x2019;s takedown of websites like Backpage.com has pushed sex trade advertising offline and back to physical locations where sex workers are more vulnerable to exploitation and law enforcement.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
	
	Working street-level is actually worse, Carmen said, because &#x201C;pimps...prey on the younger females that are in f---ed up situations.&#x201D;
	
	As for reports of minors being trafficked on Backpage, it was Carmen&#x2019;s opinion that criminal activity &#x201C;can happen on any site, and shutting them down makes it harder to find.&#x201D;&amp;nbsp;
	
	She added that the most vulnerable might not be able to access Web forums. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m not sure that those women who are most at risk for being abused by clients and pimps really have the resources&#x201D; to navigate the internet and sell their time, she said.&amp;nbsp;
	
	Runaways and drug addicts might not have access to reliable Wi-Fi internet or smartphones, for example.
	
	Those &#x201C;who are ignorant to the internet [have] been forced to the streets,&#x201D; Carmen said.
	
	Whether new websites will come to fill the space of dismantled forums like Backpage, or shall be pulled down in turn, is still unclear. The new legislation affects only websites hosted in the United States, so foreign domains may step in as hosts.
	
	&#x201C;People always say that,&#x201D; said Cunningham, &#x201C;but I really think that FOSTA-SESTA will be the end of accessible online classified ads for sex workers. I hope that I&#x2019;m wrong.&#x201D;&amp;nbsp;
	
	The new law may drive criminal behavior underground &#x2014; but, Cunningham questioned, to what end?
	
	&#x201C;Is the goal to prevent human trafficking? Or is the goal to disrupt the sex market? If the goal is to find these lost women, then sites like Backpage really help that by making them visible.&#x201D;&amp;nbsp;

	Durham City Council Reaffirms Diversity Values in Statement Regarding Scheduled DPAC Lecturer&lt;/span&gt;(POLITICS) &#x2014; Canadian psychologist and cultural critic Jordan Peterson&#x2019;s September 10 lecture scheduled at the Durham Performing Arts Center (DPAC) found more disapproval in Durham Mayor Pro Tem Jillian Johnson and her six fellow City Council members. Johnson posted a statement on her &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/ProTemJillianJ/posts/928000017379180" target="_blank"&gt;Facebook page&lt;/a&gt; cosigned by all Council members that publicly denounces Peterson&#x2019;s views on gender and race. These views are among the subjects of his popular YouTube videos and New York Times bestselling book, &#x201C;12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos&#x201D;; this is also the name of his current tour. 
	
	The statement read, in part, that &#x201C;as many in our community have been disturbed and angered by Mr. Peterson&#x2019;s racist, misogynist, and transphobic views, we would like to use this opportunity to reiterate our commitments and values to all of you as your elected representatives.&#x201D; 
	
	The Council members reassured free speech advocates that they are not attempting to use governmental interference to prevent Peterson from speaking, but said, &#x201C;We wish to emphasize that a person&#x2019;s right to free speech does not include the right to a platform or an audience.&#x201D; 
	
	Peterson has taken a combative stance against leftist politics and what he views as its propagation of "cultural Marxism," postmodern philosophy and concepts like white privilege and the patriarchy. He positions himself a voice of moderation and centrism.
	
	Defenders of Peterson have taken to social media and online think pieces&#x2019; comment sections arguing that he has been unfairly linked to the alt-right, an element comprised of white nationalists.
	
	DPAC, on their &lt;a href="https://www.dpacnc.com/events/detail/dr-jordan-peterson" target="_blank"&gt;page&lt;/a&gt; for the event, describes Peterson as &#x201C;a clinical psychologist, cultural critic, former Harvard Professor, and currently a professor at the University of Toronto. His main areas of study are the psychology of religion and ideological belief, and the assessment and improvement of personality and performance.&#x201D;&amp;nbsp;

	New Train Station Opens in Raleigh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;(TRANSPORTATION) &#x2014; The newly constructed Union Station in Raleigh officially opened in the early morning of Tuesday, July 10 and will be servicing Amtrak passenger trains as a hub for their New York&#x2013;to-Miami &#x201C;Silver Star&#x201D; route, and as both the first and final destination for the North Carolina &#x201C;Piedmont&#x201D; route shuttling commuters between Charlotte and Raleigh.	The downtown station, which is located at the former Dillon Supply Company Warehouse at 510 West Martin Street, was originally scheduled to start serving customers in early June, and the city even hosted an official dedication ceremony on April 30. But the opening was pushed back because contractors needed to adjust a 1 percent imperfection in the platform slope so as to bring it up to specifications required by federal transportation standards. 
	
	The construction project was paid for by local, state, federal and private funds, and the design was primarily developed by the North Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT). The impetus for the larger and more centrally placed rail stop in the capital was driven largely by the area&#x2019;s steady population growth, shifting demographics and the surge in demand for new mass transit options.           
	
	As of 6:30 AM on Tuesday, four round trips from Union Station to Charlotte became available daily, with regular stops in Cary, Durham, Burlington, Greensboro, High Point, Salisbury and Kannapolis. 
	
	Approximately 151,000 people flowed into and out of Raleigh&#x2019;s Amtrak stop in 2017, and the stop was ranked by NCDOT as the state&#x2019;s second busiest, exceeded only by Charlotte.

	Four Drown in a Month off Carolina Coast&lt;/span&gt;(WEATHER) &#x2014;The North Carolina coast has been the site four drowning deaths in the past month when recreational bathers caught in strong rip currents were unable to swim to shore. Since June 10, 21-year-old Justin Eakes of Greenville, 17-year-old Elijah Hinnant of Wayne County, 16-year-old Tyreese Worsley of Goldsboro and one unidentified man were either found dead in the water or died shortly afterward while under medical care.
	
	According to data collected by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the deaths of 54 persons in North Carolina have been attributed to coastal rip currents between 1996 and 2017. The United States Lifesaving Association reports on its website that that the yearly average for the nation is close to 100.  
	
	The National Weather Service has issued rip current forecasts for both Morehead City and Wilmington.
	
	Meteorologists across the state have made note of a recent increase in the number of surface gravity waves (as opposed to wind-generated waves), more commonly known as swell, resulting in heavy surf and hazardous conditions; this is especially true for more vulnerable beachgoers, such as children and the elderly. 
	
	Drowning deaths associated with rip current activity generally occur off the shores with little to no lifeguard protection, which is why visitors to such areas should do their best to educate themselves on the phenomenon&#x2019;s visual cues, like a &#x201C;river&#x201D; of foam running perpendicular to wave breaks and an opaque, muddy discoloration in the water. 
	
	Swimmers are also advised to not venture out alone, to obey all lifeguard instructions and to stay at least 100 feet from piers or jetties. Wearing polarized sunglasses is also suggested to increase visual acuity for spotting dangers.</body>

	Scratch Bakery Hit by Burglars&lt;/span&gt;(CRIME) &#x2014; The popular Bull City p&#xE2;tisserie Scratch Bakery suffered property damage and the theft of cash sometime between its evening closing on Tuesday, July 10 and its normally scheduled opening on Wednesday, July 11. 
	
	Employees arrived at the store around 5 AM Wednesday to find their front display pane glass smashed by a baseball-sized stone. Upon examination of the interior, it was discovered that $180 in cash had been pilfered from the front register. The still-unidentified burglars did not, however, make off with any additional material goods from premises, such as their high-end alcohol or specialized equipment. 
	
	Scratch is owned and operated by James Beard award-finalist Chef Phoebe Lawless, who first opened her flagship bakery of the same name eight years ago on Orange Street, but closed in February when she deemed the commercial viability of that location too low. The current location opened in the fall of 2017.
	
	The break-in delayed the bakery&#x2019;s opening by only one hour, and is not expected to cause significant financial hardship.
	
	Durham Police Department investigators are currently seeking assistance from the public in determining the culprit. Anyone with information is encouraged to call Durham Crime Stoppers at 919-683-1200.

	App-Enabled Scooter Rental Comes to Raleigh &#x2014; Will It Stay?&lt;/span&gt;(TRANSPORTATION) &#x2014; A Santa Monica&#x2013;based scooter company known as Bird began operating in a few sections of Raleigh on Wednesday, July 11, much to the consternation of city officials who claim that they have not signed off on the alternative transport venture, which has been the subject of controversy in other urban areas across the country. The company&#x2019;s press release gleamed with optimism, stating, "We are excited to bring our affordable, environmentally friendly transportation option to the people and communities of Raleigh.&#x201D; It went on to pitch its benefits: &#x201C;Birds are perfect for those 'last mile' trips that are too long to walk, but too short to drive."   
	
	Bird is another member of the rideshare economy using a smartphone reservation model, similar to the grab-and-go rental company Zipcar, which operates within each city of the Triangle. The business places a group of the electric, two-wheel, standing scooters in a populated area for commuters or tourists that are accessible to use through a smartphone app account. The app wirelessly unlocks a nearby scooter and charges the appropriate debit or credit card, at which point the rider is free to operate the vehicle on open city roads. The scooters are termed &#x201C;dockless,&#x201D; meaning users are not required to return the machine to a fixed central port or hub at the end of their rental period. The Bird &lt;a href="https://www.bird.co/how" target="_blank"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; encourages use in bike lanes, and use on sidewalks, highways and turnpikes is forbidden.  
	
	Bird has developed a reputation as an upstart start-up that from not always getting approval from municipal authorities prior to appearing in a new area. This has resulted in pushback from safety officials and others in leadership roles, especially as reports of accidental injuries have come to their attention.
	
	The company&#x2019;s hometown of Santa Monica, a high-density beach community in the Los Angeles metropolitan area, filed a $300,000 lawsuit against them for operating without a business license after at least one serious head injury of a Bird customer received local media coverage. Helmets are not provided with the scooter, but encouraged on the website.
	
	San Francisco went a step further and imposed a temporary ban on Bird&#x2019;s operations (as well as of another scooter rental company known as Lime) until sanctioned applications made their way through the proper channels.        
	
	John Boyette, a Raleigh public information officer, spoke to the News &amp;amp; Observer about Bird. He did not make a claim of impending punitive action, only that "we are assessing the situation to determine our best of course of action."
	
	&lt;br&gt;
	
	&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;State News
	
	State Prisons Admit Improper Handling of Controlled Substances, Settle in Federal Case&lt;/span&gt;(GOVERNMENT) &#x2014; Prison officials with the North Carolina Department of Public Safety (DPS) have chosen to pay out $190,000 in settlements regarding claims by federal investigators, avoiding further investigation and a legal battle with the U.S. Department of Justice that could have resulted in a much more expensive judgment against the state.The agreement acknowledges institutional misconduct related to the dispensing of controlled substances by staff employees at least two correctional institutions, both located in the Raleigh area. State authorities will not dispute the 88 cases of improper documentation of scheduled prescription drug use at both North Carolina Correctional Center for Women and Central Prison, which houses the state&#x2019;s death row inmates, among others. 
	
	The DOJ&#x2019;s media release did not indicate evidence of outright corruption, stating "while no unlawful use of controlled substances was detected, the substandard recordkeeping provided fertile ground for improper diversion." The implication was that opportunities for serious malfeasance, including illegal narcotic sales, were facilitated by those conditions described by the DOJ&#x2019;s claims.
	
	Secretary of the N.C. Department of Public Safety Erik Hooks responded with a written statement taking responsibility for his organization&#x2019;s flaws in oversight. "I agreed for the department to take responsibility for past practices with the understanding that extensive corrective actions were taken to address this issue,&#x201D; he stated. 
	
	The nature of such &#x201C;corrective actions&#x201D; have not been elaborated on, but federal scrutiny of the prisons&#x2019; medical practices will certainly continue even after the financial settlement is paid.&lt;br&gt;</body>

	Eldlerly Couple Mugged Outside Apartments, Mugger at Large&lt;/span&gt;(CRIME) &#x2014; The Durham Police Department is seeking help from the public in identifying a man who mugged an elderly couple in their wheelchairs on the afternoon of Wednesday, July 11.
	
	Wayne Huggins and his partner Barbara were returning home from a trip to Northgate Mall, where Barbara had just gotten a haircut, and the two had taken their normal bus route back to the neighborhood where they rent an apartment together at the Lofts at Southside at 703 South Roxboro Street.
	
	It is unclear whether the couple noticed the fellow passenger who committed the mugging, but when they exited the bus at a Chestnut Street stop approximately a block from their home, the man in question followed them to their apartment building. The unidentified man forcibly removed a necklace from around Barbara&#x2019;s neck and unsuccessfully attempted to remove a ring from one of her fingers. He then turned his attention to Wayne, who fought until the mugger left.
	
	Police have released photographs captured by the bus security camera that clearly show the suspect&#x2019;s face and body. They are available for viewing on the Durham Police Facebook page, as well as television station WTVD&#x2019;s website.
	
	Anyone with information is asked to contact Investigator K. Emanuel at 919-560-4415, extension 29306.&amp;nbsp;

	Al&#x2019;s Burger Shack Titled Best Burger Restaurant in USA by TripAdvisor&lt;/span&gt;(FOOD) &#x2014; Trip Advisor, a popular travel review and booking website, named Al&#x2019;s Burger Shack, of Franklin Street, the best burger restaurant in the country on Wednesday, July 11. Al&#x2019;s, a favorite of the Chapel Hill casual dining scene, may have just taken its first step from local treasure to high-profile eatery with far-reaching brand recognition. Its signature burger is the Bobo Chili Cheeseburger.
	
	The Shack first opened the doors to its flagship location on the Chapel Hill&#x2013;Carrboro town line in 2013, born of the culinary imagination of Al Bowers, a UNC graduate with an industrial relations degree. His passion for cooking and the hamburger arts led him to conceive an establishment dedicated to fresh ingredients and old-school technique.            
	
	Despite its German name, the hamburger has long been a top contender for national dish status here in the United States. Surveys of the American appetite have estimated that approximately 50 million beef patties between buns or rolls are consumed annually within our borders, which averages three per person every week.    
	
	It did not take long for Al&#x2019;s Burger Shack to gain a reputation for quality, and for his food to garner comparisons to burger-snob favorites like Five Guys and In-N-Out. Within five years, the restaurant&#x2019;s success allowed Bowers to expand to an additional location in the tony Southern Village community a few miles from downtown.
	
	It is too early to say whether the TripAdvisor ranking will be a game changer for Bowers and his staff, but elite publications catering to the national foodie subculture have already taken notice.  The restaurant industry is intensely competitive, and connoisseurs with deep pockets are often willing to trek far and wide in search of the cr&#xE8;me de la cr&#xE8;me. 
	
	The number two burger spot named was Brooks Gourmet Burgers &amp;amp; Dogs in Naples, Florida. This was followed by Lincoln, Nebraska&#x2019;s patriotically named Honest Abe&#x2019;s Burgers &amp;amp; Freedom. Urban gastronomic hotspots New York City and Los Angeles are not represented on the top 10 list.&amp;nbsp;

	Racial Graffiti Defaces Civil Rights Mural&lt;/span&gt;(ART) &#x2014; A mural commissioned by the American Civil Liberties Union and painted by North Carolina State University graduate Dare Coulter, depicting a host of historic civil rights protest vignettes, was found defiled with crude messages written with a Sharpie on Wednesday, July 11.
	
	The 30-by-20-foot mural includes artistic interpretations of iconic images, such as the famous 1968 Black Power raised-fist salutes of Olympic athletes Tommie Smith and John Carlos at the Mexico City Summer Olympics, and the 2017 Women&#x2019;s March on Washington. The location chosen for the mural was a section of the Boylan-Pearce building at 216 Fayetteville Street. 
	
	The hand-scrawled defacement consisted of racially charged exclamations including, "The north convinced the blacks to be lured by factories, where they could be legally regulated into poverty. b/c they were broke," and "They convinced yall to hate the only people who ever fought the gov't." 
	
	Coulter told the News &amp;amp; Observer that she plans to restore the mural by painting over the unwelcome graffiti as soon as she is able to, but that its occurrence doesn&#x2019;t necessarily surprise her, given America&#x2019;s current political polarization. 
	
	The mural was the result of about 10 days&#x2019; labor on Coulter&#x2019;s part, and according to the police report, the damage is estimated at close to $1000.    </body>

	&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;White Rhino Born At North Carolina Zoo&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;
	
	(NATURE) &#x2014; The North Carolina Zoo in Asheboro announced the birth of a southern white rhinoceros calf on Friday, July 13, the zoo&#x2019;s second such birth within an 11-day period. The birth took place in a specially cultivated grasslands portion of the artificial habitat designed specifically for breeding the subspecies.
	
	Zookeepers are keeping a watchful eye on the newborn&#x2019;s development, but say that she is currently healthy and growing at a normal rate. She is expected to gain approximately 100 pounds per month for the first year of her life and could reach a maximum weight of 5,500 pounds when fully mature.
	
	The statement posted on their official Facebook page stated, &#x201C;The Zoo has had rhinos since 1976 and is part of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) Species Survival Plan (SSP) to keep a sustainable population of southern white rhinos under human care. It&#x2019;s also involved in global conservation efforts to save this species.&#x201D;
	
	The southern white rhino is classified as a &#x201C;near threatened&#x201D; species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, meaning that it does not qualify for near-extinction status, but is at risk and will be reevaluated intermittently. Estimates of the number of white rhinos living in the wild range from 19,862 to 21,077. They are the second largest land mammals after elephants.
	
	The the other subspecies of white rhinoceros, the northern white rhino, is on the brink of extinction. The last known male northern white rhinoceros died in March 2018.

	&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Organized Crime Bust in Greensboro&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
	
	(ARRESTS) &#x2014; Seven alleged members of what police are calling the "Williams Crime Organization" were arrested after a seven-month investigation involving a coordinated effort between Burlington police and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. 
	
	According to a joint press release by multiple agency chiefs, the criminal probe culminated in a raid in which nine guns, nine vehicles and an undisclosed amount of crack cocaine and MDMA (commonly known as ecstasy) were seized. It was also reported that at least four of the firearms and vehicles were stolen, although authorities have not provided any more specifics as the investigation is considered ongoing. 
	
	The man whom police alleged to be the ringleader has been charged on one count of continuing a criminal enterprise, four counts of possession of firearm by a felon, one count of trafficking in cocaine, six counts of obtaining property by false pretense and four counts of extortion and felony exploitation of the elderly and disabled. He is being held on $1 million bail at the Alamance County Detention Center.  
	
	Officials are still searching for Sherie Marie Thompson, 33, and Nathaniel Gary, 64, of Burlington. Anybody with information may call the Burlington Police Department at 336-229-3500.

	&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Franklin Street Club's New Membership Application Draws Criticism&lt;/span&gt;
	
	(COMMUNITY) &#x2014; The Library, a Franklin Street bar and club favored by UNC students, announced a policy change for which it has faced social media backlash, since some view the rule as exclusionary. The change will exchange the traditional cover charge system, in which a small fee is collected from a customer upon entry at the door, for membership to enter, involving an extensive membership application process. 
	
	It is not unusual for businesses serving liquor in North Carolina to be designated as "social clubs." State law prevents a business from operating as a bar whose primary source of revenue derives from alcohol sales. An exception is made for private clubs that charge a membership fee.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;
	
	For those seeking to join under the Library's new process, the first step includes paying an initial application fee of $25. The fee itself, however, does not guarantee approval. In addition to the applicant&#x2019;s basic personal information, the requisite membership form contains a field in which details on job status, including length of current employment, must be provided. The Library&#x2019;s management is also asking for some substantiating proof of employment in the form of a recent pay stub or an up-to-date W-2 document. The membership form makes an exception for full-time students who may be unable to work.
	
	Would-be patrons must also consent to a criminal background check before vetting can be finalized. It was not specified which type felonies or misdemeanors would prohibit membership.
	
	People identifying themselves as current and former UNC students posted negative comments on Twitter immediately, with some claiming the policy shift targets low-income patrons and students of color. 
	
	User R.C. Robinson tweeted, &#x201C;The Library has really gone downhill since they hired Jim Crow as the bouncer.&#x201D;
	
	North Carolina alcohol regulations stipulate that any establishment serving liquor that does not make more than 30 percent of its revenue from food sales must be registered as a private club. Exceptions are made for hotels and businesses operating as private clubs. Many bar businesses operating as private clubs opt to charge patrons a small fee (typically $3 or $5) for a lifetime membership.
	
	The Library&#x2019;s co-owner, Stephen Saez, told the News &amp;amp; Observer that he sees the system overhaul as a proactive response to legitimate safety concerns, and that pressure from local police to cull troublemakers from their client base meant that management could no longer drag their feet on the issue.&lt;br&gt;</body>

    <title>The Cost of Protecting Silent Sam? Almost $400,000, Says UNC</title>
    <subhead></subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>CHAPEL HILL &#x2014; The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill spent $390,000 to protect Silent Sam in the 2017-2018 fiscal year, according to a short official statement released Thursday, July 12. Silent Sam is a controversial statue that commemorates those UNC-Chapel Hill students who fought for the Confederacy during the Civil War. It has been the target of protests and vandalism in recent years.
	
	The statement made clear that the funds were used for an increase in police presence at the site, maintenance of surveillance equipment and payments to &#x201C;outside law enforcement agencies&#x201D; who assisted campus police in their efforts. The details of that assistance are unclear. 
	
	The statement withheld details, saying, &#x201C;As is consistent with best practices in law enforcement, the University cannot disclose further specifics of these campus security operations. In addition, University Facilities spent approximately $3,000 to clean the monument after vandalism during the fiscal year.&#x201D;  
	
	The &lt;a href="https://piedmontsundial.com/calendar/calendar_main_article.php?theArticle=107" target="_blank"&gt;most high-profile defacement&lt;/a&gt; involved graduate student Maya Little, who poured red paint and blood on the lower half of the memorial in front of a small group of activists and reporters. Little was arrested shortly afterward, and the monument was pressure-washed clean by custodial staff. 
	
	But Thursday&#x2019;s statement stressed that university administration was more worried about the actions of non-student groups. &#x201C;Protecting the monument is always secondary to the safety of the people around it. The campus community has a long tradition of peaceful protests and respectful debate. Public safety officials and administrators are most concerned about outside groups, over which the University has no control and who may appear without warning,&#x201D; the statement said.     
	
	UNC Chancellor Carol Folt has consistently maintained the position that if the decision were hers to make, Silent Sam would have been removed from school grounds long ago, and that the major obstacle to its removal is 2015 state law that protects objects of remembrance from movement without approval from the state&#x2019;s General Assembly.   </body>

    <title>CDC Will Test for Toxins From Chemours Plant</title>
    <subhead>Chemical produced for non-stick cookware thought to contaminate groundwater</subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>NORTH CAROLINA &#x2014; The Centers for Disease Control agreed to partner with North Carolina&#x2019;s Department of Health and Human Services to conduct &#x201C;limited testing&#x201D; for the chemical GenX, as well as 16 additional compounds that may pose health risks for residents living near Chemours&#x2019;s Fayetteville Works facility in Bladen County. 
	
	The statement released to media outlets on July 17 indicated that &#x201C;the blood and urine of up to 30 residents&#x201D; living near the Chemours facility would be analyzed for evidence of exposure to perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), GenX being a brand of certain PFAS. These compounds are used primarily in the manufacture of non-stick cookware, fabrics that repel water, stain-resistant textiles and carpeting, cosmetics, firefighting foams and products that resist grease and oils. 
	
	&#x201C;This testing comes after the Department of Environmental Quality directed Chemours to conduct sampling of drinking water wells at residences located near the [Chemours Plant],&#x201D; the press release stated. &#x201C;The purpose of the testing is to determine if PFAS can be detected in blood or urine from residents in the area, and if so, how their levels compare to levels detected from other parts of the country.&#x201D;
	
	According to Cobey Culton of the NC DHHS communications office, testing cannot expand beyond 30 individuals &#x201C;because of the CDC&#x2019;s own capabilities.&#x201D; Culton also confirmed that the project originated within the state organization, which specifically requested the federal government&#x2019;s assistance. 
	
	Extensive analysis of GenX and its interactions with the human body has not been released. However, the Environmental Protection Agency states on its website that there were &#x201C;past concerns with perfluorinated substances&#x201D; so they typically require testing of new ones. Between 2000 and 2002, with the EPA&#x2019;s urging, many companies voluntarily reduced or stopped usage of the chemicals.
	
	The CDC&#x2019;s website states that exposure to related fluorochemicals can occur from drinking contaminated water or eating fish caught in contaminated water, as well as inadvertently ingesting contaminated soil or dust. It also states that &#x201C;exposure&#x2026;from today&#x2019;s consumer products is usually low.&#x201D; Babies can be born with exposure through their mothers&#x2019; exposure &#x201C;during pregnancy and while breastfeeding.&#x201D;
	
	People living in the affected area, or those who are simply curious about the testing process, are encouraged to contact the Occupational and Environmental Epidemiology Branch in DHHS's Division of Public Health at 919-707-5900.

    <title>Greensboro Condemns Former Youth Transitional Home</title>
    <subhead></subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>GREENSBORO &#x2014; City officials have condemned New Day Transitional Housing, a former youth home at 4501 Old Battleground Road, saying among other things that its operators no longer hold proper state licensing for a youth mental health facility.
	
	The facility had been the subject of a series of negative comments on the smartphone app Nextdoor mostly regarding an increase in criminal activity that neighbors say are tied to residents of the halfway house. New Day was condemned on July 8 following an electrical fire, but questions remain.
	
	Most of the comments on Nextdoor came from people who reside near the address, many of whom said they did not know what the building was being used for. Citing suspicious activity, neighbors contacted city leaders.
	
	The Sundial spoke via phone to Dawn Grosvenor at the office of the Community Relations Manager, who confirmed reports of criminal activity near the facility, although she could not definitively link them to the transitional house. "There were break-ins to vehicles in the neighborhood surrounding the area. We don't know if it&#x2018;s related to this location or not, but some residents had the feeling that it was a one-plus-one-equals-two type of thing."
	
	Local CBS television affiliate WFMY published a letter from Greensboro Community Relations Manager Donna Grey on its website that a citizen received after reporting the concerns.
	
	&#x201C;The Community Relations office communicated with the Department of Health and Human Services in Raleigh,&#x201D; the letter stated. It went on, &#x201C;This facility no longer holds a license as a youth mental health facility and was operating as New Day Transitional Housing. The City had not been informed of a change of use for this property.&#x201D; 
	
	Grey&#x2019;s letter also said that a recent inspection by the city&#x2019;s fire department found multiple code violations, and that a notice of re-inspection was issued to the property owner.
	
	The Greensboro Fire Department was not the only municipal agency to find fault with the facility. &#x201C;The Zoning Department determined that the location could be utilized under the current zoning to house up 30 people as a transitional housing facility,&#x201D; the letter read. It continued, &#x201C;but found [in] excess of 30 people staying at the location and issued a notice of violation with the order to reduce the number of occupants to 30 people by 7/30/18.&#x201D;
	
	WFMY reported that New Day was being operated by United Youth Care Services, which describes itself on its website as a multi-service addiction and mental health rehabilitation program, the centerpiece of which is an &#x201C;Intensive Outpatient Program,&#x201D; that &#x201C;incorporates chemical addiction treatments, including Twelve Step facilitation and Motivational Interviewing, with Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) skills and other cognitive and behavioral health approaches.&#x201D; 
	
	The Sundial reached out to United Youth Care Services, but was told over the telephone that no staff member would comment on the New Day facility, or even confirm any ties the company may have to the property.   
	
	Guilford County tax records identify the current owner as Yreva Enterprises LLC, and lists its current usage category as &#x201C;homes for the aged &#x2014; assisted living &amp;amp; skilled care.&#x201D; The Sundial was unable to reach Yreva by phone. A search on the OpenCorporates database shows a business with that name having been dissolved in 2017.
	
	The property was damaged by an electrical fire on July 8, although no injuries were reported. The building was subsequently condemned by the fire marshal, and residents were shuttled to local motels, where they will stay either until remodeling is completed or a new up-to-code house is purchased by the operators of New Day.
	
	Under the current circumstances, Grey is encouraging anyone who sees activity at the condemned address to call the police department&#x2019;s non-emergency line at 336-373-2222.</body>

    <title>Six Amendments to NC Constitution Will Be on Fall Ballot </title>
    <subhead></subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>&lt;p class="bodyparagraph"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 18px;"&gt;NORTH CAROLINA &#x2014; Six proposed amendments to the North Carolina Constitution will be on the state&#x2019;s general election ballot November 6, giving voters with a half dozen yes-or-no decisions on a wide array of issues. Each proposal is summarized below.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="bodyparagraph"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 18px;"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="bodyparagraph"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 18px;"&gt;The state&#x2019;s Constitutional Amendments Publication Commission will meet in Raleigh on July 31 to formulate explanatory summaries for the six proposals that will appear on the ballot. The commission has extended to the public an invitation to offer suggestions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="bodyparagraph"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 18px;"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="bodyparagraph"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 18px;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Amendment Proposals&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="bodyparagraph"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 18px;"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="bodyparagraph"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 18px;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. The North Carolina Right to Hunt and Fish Amendment: &lt;/b&gt;If passed, this proposal would amend Article I of the North Carolina Constitution, enshrining a right to make use of so-called "traditional" methods of hunting, fishing and harvesting state wildlife. The amendment would place the right to regulate hunting and fishing in North Carolina exclusively under the North Carolina General Assembly (still subject to federal protections, but eliminating local control). This proposal would add North Carolina to a list of 21 other states with similar constitutional provisions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="bodyparagraph"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 18px;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="bodyparagraph"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 18px;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. The North Carolina Marsy's Law Crime Victims Rights Amendment: &lt;/b&gt;Passage of this proposal would grant future victims of crime a list of guaranteed rights. These include a right to timely notice of court proceedings; to be reasonably heard at court proceedings; to be present at most proceedings; to timely restitution; to receive accurate information regarding court proceedings; to be notified upon the escape, release, or paroling of the accused; and to present views or concerns to the governor or proper state agency. This proposal is part of a national campaign named for 1983 California murder victim Marsalee Nicholas. As it stands, six states have passed a version of a Marsy&#x2019;s Law and none have been defeated at the ballot box.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="bodyparagraph"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 18px;"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="bodyparagraph"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 18px;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. The North Carolina Legislative Appointments to Elections&lt;/b&gt; &lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Board and Commissions Amendment:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; A&lt;/span&gt;n affirmative vote to the first of two politically charged proposals would mean the governorship would be stripped of the power to appoint any of the Bipartisan State Board of Elections &amp;amp; Ethics Enforcement members.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="bodyparagraph"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 18px;"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="bodyparagraph"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 18px;"&gt;Background: In 2017, the General Assembly passed a law that dissolved the North Carolina Ethics Commission and the State Elections Board, a second attempt at combining the two bodies after a court ruling overturned a similar law passed by the General Assembly in 2016. A ruling by the North Carolina Supreme Court in 2018 upheld the 2017 law, but denied the General Assembly's attempt to shift the power of appointments from North Carolina's governor to state legislators.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="bodyparagraph"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 18px;"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="bodyparagraph"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 18px;"&gt;The new board has nine members, eight of whom are currently selected by the governor. This proposal has grown out of the conflict between Democratic Governor Roy Cooper and leaders of the Republican-controlled General Assembly, with each side accusing the other in court of unconstitutional behavior. This amendment, if it were to pass, would shift all appointment decisions of the new regulatory body responsible for the administration of elections enforcement and ethics oversight in the hands of the legislature. Four of the eight board members would be chosen by the Senate and four by the House, and no more than four members could be registered with a single political party.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="bodyparagraph"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 18px;"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="bodyparagraph"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 18px;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. The North Carolina Judicial Selection for Midterm Vacancies Amendment: &lt;/b&gt;Another product of the state government&#x2019;s partisan polarization, an affirmative vote here would mean that judicial vacancies occurring between state court elections would no longer be filled by the governor's appointees.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="bodyparagraph"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 18px;"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="bodyparagraph"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 18px;"&gt;Instead, a new process would be instituted involving the creation of a judicial commission to select a list of candidates that would then be narrowed down to two by the General Assembly. The Governor would then pick the nominee from the list of two. The commission members would be chosen by the General Assembly, the supreme court chief justice and the governor. The process by which the appointments are made would be set by statute. There would be a 10-day window for the governor&#x2019;s appointment, and if the governor failed to act, then the legislature would have the power to make the appointment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="bodyparagraph"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 18px;"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="bodyparagraph"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 18px;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. The North Carolina Income Tax Cap Amendment: &lt;/b&gt;The passage of this amendment would amend Section 2, Article V of the constitution to lower the maximum state income tax rate from 10 percent to 7 percent. The current personal income tax rate is 5.499 percent.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="bodyparagraph"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 18px;"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="bodyparagraph"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 18px;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;6. The North Carolina Voter ID Amendment: &lt;/b&gt;If passed, this proposal would require any North Carolina voter who votes in person to present a valid photo identification. The proposal does not specify what forms of ID would be acceptable; details would be worked out by state lawmakers after passage.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="bodyparagraph"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 18px;"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="bodyparagraph"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 18px;"&gt;In 2013, the United States Supreme Court decision in Shelby County v. Holder invalidated Section 4(b) of the 1965 Voting Rights Act, which had prevented some states &#x2014; specifically, those with low voter registration and/or tests for voting in certain tracked years, mostly southern states &#x2014; from changing their voting laws without first seeking federal approval.&lt;/span&gt;</body>

    <title>First NC Death from West Nile Virus in 2018</title>
    <subhead></subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>NORTH CAROLINA &#x2014; The North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services announced that the state&#x2019;s first death from West Nile virus this year occurred last week.&amp;nbsp;
	
	West Nile virus is commonly spread to people by mosquito bites, and can cause serious or fatal symptoms in about 1 out of 150 infected people, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&amp;nbsp;
	
	In the interest of protecting privacy, the DHHS did not release the name or information about the deceased, other than to say that the person was an adult living in the southeastern section of the state.
	
	&#x201C;Most people who become infected with West Nile virus experience no symptoms or a mild, flu-like illness,&#x201D; the DHHS's press release read. &#x201C;However, about 20 percent of people who are infected will develop a fever with other symptoms such as headache, body aches, joint pains, vomiting, diarrhea or rash.&#x201D;
	
	Most of that 20 percent who become ill are diagnosed with what is called West Nile fever. A group within those who are symptomatic, around 1 percent, will have an extreme reaction, developing an associated encephalitis, meningitis or even a reversible form of paralysis. A smaller percentage of those infected will be killed by the virus.
	
	The primary agent that spreads West Nile virus to humans is the female mosquito (male mosquitoes don&#x2019;t feed on blood), and in most cases they are picking it up from a nonhuman host, usually a bird. Direct human-to-human transmission is considered to be rare and limited to laboratories or exposure to infected blood.
	
	&#x201C;West Nile virus is one of several mosquito-borne viruses that can be acquired in North Carolina,&#x201D; the DHHS statement continued. &#x201C;Other mosquito-borne viruses transmitted in the state that cause human illness include La Crosse and Eastern equine encephalitis viruses.&#x201D;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;
	
	According to statistics published by the CDC, between 2012 and 2017 seven people in North Carolina died of the virus out of a total of 25 cases. Counting cases going back to the first recorded infection in 2002, North Carolina's death toll from West Nile is 48.
	
	West Nile virus has infected more than 44,000 people in the United States since 1999 and has killed more than 1,900, according to the CDC.
	
	DHHS's press release included suggestions for mosquito bite prevention, such as using an EPA-registered chemical repellent, installing and repairing window screens and dumping or replacing standing water such as pet bowls and bird baths at least once a week.
	
	There is no specific treatment currently available for West Nile infection other than administering medication to help ease symptoms. No human vaccine for West Nile virus is available, though clinical trials for a vaccine, funded by the National Institute for Health, began in 2015</body>

    <body>News and notes from the Piedmont and Triangle.
	
	&lt;br&gt;
	
	&lt;b&gt;Orange County  &lt;/b&gt;
	
	(DEVELOPMENT) &#x2014; The Town of Chapel Hill is asking residents to consider joining civil planning staffers and other officials at &#x201C;drop-in sessions&#x201D; in September to discuss the town&#x2019;s land use objectives, part of Chapel Hill&#x2019;s &#x201C;Charting Our Future&#x201D; initiative.
	
	The sessions are to be held at the police substation located in University Place, each Wednesday and Friday of September from 11:30 AM to 1:30 PM.  
	
	Attendees are invited to submit comment on the Charting Our Future Initiative, which the town bills as a reimagining of land use in future development projects in the Town of Chapel Hill.&amp;nbsp;
	
	The Charting Our Future Initiative will be implemented in two phases.  &#x201C;The first phase will hone the Future Land Use Map (FLUM), which is called the Land Use Plan in Chapel Hill 2020, the Town&#x2019;s Comprehensive Plan,&#x201D; according to the Town of Chapel Hill&#x2019;s website.
	
	 The second phase &#x201C;will rewrite the Town&#x2019;s Land Use Management Ordinance (LUMO), with the overall goal of improving the town&#x2019;s land use tools and processes so that they are more predictable, functional, and intentional.&#x201D;  
	
	At a Chapel Hill Town Council meeting in late June, outgoing town manager Roger Stancil delivered his office&#x2019;s own recommendations for the direction of the initiative.  He stated special effort should be focused on three gateways into Chapel Hill, citing that &#x201C;the extension to the downtown of Carrboro, the extension of NC 54 to 15-501 and expansion to both sides of Homestead Road [should be] done immediately.&#x201D;	        
	
	&lt;br&gt;
	
	&lt;b&gt;Durham County&lt;/b&gt;
	
	(CAMPUS LIFE) &#x2014; Dean of the Duke University Divinity School, Elaine Heath, stepped down from her position Thursday, August 2, according to a statement posted on the Duke website that morning.  
	
	Heath, who served as dean for two years, will continue to teach classes on missional and pastoral theology while maintaining a full professorship at the school. 
	
	The official announcement came from Duke University Provost Sally Kornbluth, who broke the news to school faculty and staff in an email stating, &#x201C;President Price and I are grateful to Elaine for her leadership over the past two years, and we share her excitement about continuing as a member of the Divinity School faculty.&#x201D;  
	
	Kornbluth&#x2019;s statement did not include an explanation for Heath&#x2019;s sudden resignation.
	
	Heath&#x2019;s tenure as dean was not free from controversy.  The Divinity School is affiliated with the United Methodist Church, a religious institution whose position on LGBTQ members conflicts with Duke&#x2019;s nondiscrimination policies.  
	
	Official church doctrine permits queer-identifying Methodists to attend services, but excludes them from ordination.
	
	In the early 1990&#x2019;s openly gay Duke Divinity School student and Southern Baptist John Blevins faced pressure to drop out before graduation after being told his denomination would never grant him ordination as a preacher.  Blevins proved them wrong on April 5, 1992 when Olin T. Binkley Memorial Baptist Church in Chapel Hill defied church leaders and voted to license him for the ministry.    
	
	     
	
	A dispute between Heath and professor of Catholic theology Paul Griffiths about the school&#x2019;s diversity training became public in May 2017.  Griffiths faced professional censure in response to a school-wide email he sent which referred to the compulsory (for faculty) racial equity classes as &#x201C;anti-intellectual.&#x201D;  
	
	Fallout from the dispute over diversity training included Griffiths resigning his position, in the face of disciplinary action against him that was implemented by Heath.                
	
	Heath was the target of criticism and protest when a group of activists disrupted her state-of-the-school address in February 2018 to demand better treatment for gay and transgender students.  Their action came after theology faculty had voted to reject a proposed course on &#x201C;queer theology&#x201D; despite the willingness of at least one adjunct instructor to create and teach the first session. 
	
	Heath will be replaced by professor Greg Jones, who already served as the Divinity School&#x2019;s dean from 1997-2010.   
	
	&lt;br&gt;
	
	   
	
	(LAW &amp;amp; JUSTICE) &#x2014; Superior Court Judge Orlando Hudson ruled on July 26 that a Texas man must pay $8.8 million for breaking up another man&#x2019;s marriage in North Carolina. 
	
	Keith King, the jilted husband, was awarded $8.8 million in damages to be paid by Francisco Huizar III of San Antonio, Texas.  
	
	King&#x2019;s suit against Huizar, filed in April 2017, stemmed from Huizard&#x2019;s affair with King&#x2019;s wife, Danielle King. 
	
	Keith King is the founder and operator of BMX Stunt Shows, a sports entertainment company specializing in a version of competitive bike riding known that is for its dangerous stunts and obstacle courses.  
	
	Attorney Joanne Foil represented King, and argued that the fallout from the breakup of the Kings&#x2019;s marriage included a substantial monetary losses. Danielle King was employed in a high-ranking position at BMX Stunt Shows until knowledge the affair reached her husband.  Huizar&#x2019;s lawyer argued that King was a controlling, manipulative husband who placed his wife in a stressful job without pay, according to &lt;a href="https://www.heraldsun.com/news/local/crime/article215577310.html" target="_blank"&gt;reporting in the Durham Herald-Sun&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;
	
	North Carolina is one of only six states nationwide still permitting the common law tort referred to as &#x201C;alienation of affection,&#x201D; wherein a spouse can demand restitution from an  interloper deemed responsible for initiating an adulterous relationship, if it results in the dissolution of a marriage.  Hawaii, Mississippi, New Mexico, South Dakota and Utah offer similar legal avenues to jilted husbands and wives.
	
	In 2011, Wake County Superior Court judge Carl Fox ordered Betty Devin, the current wife of Raleigh trucking magnate Donald Puryear, to pay $30 million to Puryear&#x2019;s former wife of 13 years Carol Puryear, citing infidelity and a subsequent divorce.  The judgement is considered by legal experts to be the largest-ever punitive sum falling under the same category.
	
	Huizar is planning an appeal, his attorney told the Herald-Sun.           </body>

    <title>State Investigators Raid Tuscarora Casinos</title>
    <subhead></subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>&lt;div&gt;ROBESON COUNTY &#x2014; State and local law enforcement closed three casinos and arrested more than 26 people in July, but members of a North Carolina organization of Tuscarora Native Americans insist that the land is sovereign and say the charges overreach.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;Agents from the Alcohol Law Enforcement (ALE) division of the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation, with the Robeson County Sheriff's Office issued charges relating to &#x201C;three illegal casinos, an unlicensed police force and an indoor marijuana grow with multiple outdoor grows&#x201D; in Maxton, Pembroke and Red Springs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;The investigation lasted a year, according to an SBI press release dated Monday, July 23. Other charges issued include money laundering and unlicensed possession of firearms.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;The SBI press release stated that many of the individuals arrested were members of a &#x201C;self-proclaimed &#x2018;sovereign citizen&#x2019; group&#x201D; and identified some of the members as &#x201C;armed and dangerous.&#x201D;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;Armed guards around the sites acted members of an unlicensed police force, as the July charges and a January ruling in Wake County Superior Court state.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;The Tuscarora people are a Native American population with precolonial roots in North Carolina. The Tuscarora Nation is recognized by the federal government as a sovereign nation in the state of New York, but not in North Carolina.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;Several organizations purport to represent the North Carolina Tuscarora, and seem to hold varying degrees of communal authority.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;During the raids, law enforcement agents seized vehicles, currency, marijuana, firearms and over 200 illegal gaming machines, according to the SBI&#x2019;s press release.&amp;nbsp;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;Among the items seized were a &#x201C;one-arm bandit, Pot of Gold and other illegal gambling machines housed in blacked-out buildings with no clocks. The casinos operated 24 hours a day, seven days a week and all had heavily-armed security who were not only unlicensed, but using blue lights in their trucks,&#x201D; the SBI press release stated.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;Local officials were alerted to activity at the properties by neighbors who filed complaints with police and the county government.&amp;nbsp;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;Only two legitimate gambling houses in North Carolina are protected by the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988, and both were established on lands reserved for the Eastern Band of Cherokees, the only American Indian group in the state that maintains federal qualifications for legal sovereignty.&amp;nbsp;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;The Tuscarora tribe has received recognition and protection by the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs only in New York, and New York tribal leaders claim sole ownership of the tribe&#x2019;s historical legacy, disputing the authenticity of the North Carolina Tuscarora.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;The Tribal Council of the Tuscarora Nation does not deny involvement with the casinos. Instead, they take the position that all three businesses were situated on land to which they make a historical and legal claim, placing it outside local, state or federal jurisdiction.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;The SBI&#x2019;s statement also asserted that a number of those arrested in Robeson County were &#x201C;making threats of war against law enforcement,&#x201D; as well as running an illegal private police force.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;In January, the Private Protective Services Board, a division of the North Carolina Department of Public Safety, filed an injunction to halt that alleged police force&#x2019;s activities.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;The defendant named in the board&#x2019;s complaint was Kendall Locklear, whose name also appears on the list of those arrested in the July raids and charged with illegally operating a casino. Locklear&#x2019;s address is listed in the court filing as 1345 Modest Road, Maxton, one of the three alleged gambling sites in Robeson County.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;Superior Court Judge Allen Baddour sided with the Private Protective Services Board, finding that Locklear, acting under alias as the &#x201C;Tuscarora Nation,&#x201D; &#x201C;has &#x2014; and continues to &#x2014; employ armed security without registering these guards with the Board.&#x201D; An injunction ordering the disbanding of the force was issued.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;The resulting injunction ordered the force disbanded, but according to a handwritten note on the filing in Wake County Superior Court, though the injunction was hand-delivered by a process server on January 22, it was &#x201C;refused.&#x201D;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;SBI public information officer Patty McQuillan said that claims of tribal sovereignty shall not complicate prosecution. &#x201C;Technically, they&#x2019;re not a sovereign nation and the tribe is not recognized by the state or federal government.&#x201D;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&#x201C;If they were a sovereign people, the search would have been problematic because the state would not have had the authority to conduct it,&#x201D; McQuillan said.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&#x201C;The media has blown this all out of proportion,&#x201D; said Timothy Jacobs, a spokesman and advocate for the Tuscarora people. Jacobs spoke briefly with the Sundial by phone, defending the right of his people to engage peacefully in any commercial enterprise they choose.&amp;nbsp;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;The casinos are part of &#x201C;an economic development and self-help program&#x201D; that exists because North Carolina&#x2019;s Tuscarora have been denied other avenues of opportunity, Jacobs said.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&#x201C;None of these lands are owned by an individual person, they&#x2019;re owned by the whole people of the Tuscarora Nation,&#x201D; Jacobs said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;Jacobs is a long-time Tuscarora activist who served six years in prison for his role in the 10-hour occupation of the newspaper offices of The Robesonian in 1988. The occupation was intended to highlight allegations of corruption against county officials. Jacobs was found guilty of kidnapping in connection with the incident, while the SBI later investigated alleged corruption in the county sheriff&#x2019;s office.&amp;nbsp;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;Robeson County tax records show that the casino in Red Springs, at 1521 Opal Road, was located on property owned by &#x201C;Kahtehnuaka Skarure&#x201D; and the Tuscarora Nation of Indians. County records show the Opal Road property was transferred to its present owner in 2013 for no cash value from a nonprofit registered in North Carolina as Cherokee Indians of Robeson County.&amp;nbsp;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;According to TuscaroraNationofIndians.org, &#x201C;Skaroreh&#x201D; and &#x201C;Katenuaka&#x201D; are two historical names for the people, meaning &#x201C;The Hemp Gatherers&#x201D; and &#x201C;People of the Submerged Pines&#x201D; respectively.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;UNC-Wilmington professor David La Vere is an ethnohistorian and author of the book, &#x201C;The Tuscarora War: Indians, Settlers and the Fight for the Carolina Colonies&#x201D;. In an interview with the Sundial, La Vere said that &#x201C;the Tuscaroras in Robeson is a complex issue in which historians have not yet developed a consensus.&#x201D;&amp;nbsp;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;Researchers do agree that a mass tribal migration from the Carolinas to the Great Lakes region occurred after displacement by European settlers in the mid-18th century. In 1722, the New York Tuscarora became the sixth tribe to join the Iroquois Confederacy.&amp;nbsp;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&#x201C;By the early 1800s, the last bit of Tuscarora reservation land in North Carolina had been extinguished,&#x201D; La Vere said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;Some North Carolina Tuscarora have claimed as their tribal lineage the Lumbee, a tribe that is recognized by North Carolina Department of Administration and is seeking federal recognition through congressional legislation.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;La Vere does not discount the possibility that a tribal heritage may have survived the centuries in one form or another, citing oral tradition as evidence. But no individuals were recognized as Tuscarora in Robeson county between 1900 and 1960, possibly because American Indian identification was tied to land ownership. This time period without record of recognized Tuscarora existence makes the case for historical continuity a challenging one.&amp;nbsp;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;Jacobs cited several colonial-era treaties that he claims would guarantee the tribe&#x2019;s access to their contested territory, if honored.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&#x201C;Our intentions are to follow through in the courts, if necessary, and give them a whole historical education of our community and our sovereignty,&#x201D; Jacobs said.&lt;br&gt;</body>

    <title>UNC Health Textbook Changed After Students' Complaints</title>
    <subhead></subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>CHAPEL HILL &#x2014; Representatives of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill announced that they have agreed to work with the publisher of the health and fitness textbook &#x201C;21st Century Wellness&#x201D;, assigned in a required undergraduate course, to edit out controversial claims regarding the moral dimensions of certain illnesses.  
	
	The most contentious line in the criticism of Hager and Lockhart&#x2019;s work was their labeling cancer, diabetes, heart disease and dementia as &#x201C;diseases of choice,&#x201D; which some students argue over-emphasizes the role individual choice plays in diseases that are also known to be hereditary and ignores social factors like poverty and access to insurance or preventative care. 
	
	In a statement released to the media, UNC officials stated that the &#x201C;[new] edits are based on student and department faculty feedback and are part of an ongoing curriculum review process by the Exercise and Sport Science Curriculum Committee.&#x201D;
	
	On Friday, July 20, the author responded publicly to criticism that made headlines a week earlier. In an email sent to the News &amp;amp; Observer, Brigham Young University professor Ron Hager insisted that his book, which he co-wrote with colleague Barbara Lockhart, contains no scientific inaccuracies and the scrutinized quotes were taken out of context. 
	
	The book states that the authors use this language &#x201C;because how we choose to live, in large part, determines the risk of being diagnosed.&#x201D; Hager told the N&amp;amp;O that their textbook has a prescriptive purpose as well as an explanatory one. 
	
	&#x201C;21st Century Wellness&#x201D;, and the online course designed around it, is meant motivate students into living a healthier and more active lifestyle, and many of his choices of what information to include were in service to that mission, Hager said. He also pointed out that the book was peer-reviewed by a panel of experts and by UNC faculty prior to its inclusion in the curriculum.
	
	Another statement from the book that drew fire from students interprets reasons for survival through the Holocaust. The passage is through the lens of concentration camp survivor and psychotherapist Victor Frankl, though in the words of Hager. 
	
	The questionable passage reads, &#x201C;he realized deep down that his life had meaning no matter how inhumanely he was being treated by his captors. The people in the camps who did not tap into the strength that comes from recognizing their intrinsic worth succumbed to the brutality to which they were subjected.&#x201D; 
	
	UNC&#x2019;s statement said the publisher &#x201C;confirmed that references to the Holocaust and to cancer as &#x2018;a disease of choice&#x2019; had already been removed from the fall 2018 edition.&#x201D;

	&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Orange County	
	
	Early Voting Will Include Sundays in Orange County&lt;/span&gt;(GOVERNMENT) &#x2014; This autumn, Orange County residents will be permitted to cast early voting ballots on Sundays for the first time in the district&#x2019;s history. The North Carolina Bipartisan State Board of Elections and Ethics Enforcement voted on August 5 to allow the policy change. 
	
	The decision was originally in the hands of the four-member, bipartisan Orange County Board of Elections. However, Orange County was one of 16 counties statewide whose election officials could not arrive at a required unanimous decision regarding the location and schedule of early voting by the July 20 target date set by the Bipartisan State Board of Elections and Ethics Enforcement, which left the decision to the new state board.  
	
	The Bipartisan State Board of Elections and Ethics Enforcement was created through legislation in 2017 and is challenged by litigation about its existence in a lawsuit brought by Governor Roy Cooper against the leaders of the North Carolina General Assembly . The NCGA&#x2019;s 2017 law dismantled the North Carolina State Ethics Commission and the State Board of Elections, combining their responsibilities in the new Board of Elections and Ethics Enforcement.
	
	The issue of Sunday voting divided Orange County&#x2019;s board along party lines, with the two Republican members stating at a July public meeting that they would never support a plan that includes Sundays in early voting. Consequently, the county board members were required to submit three alternative plans to the state board for their consideration and ultimate approval. It was the two Democratic affiliates of the county board who proposed the now-adopted plan.
	
	The state-approved plan will place early voting locations at the Board of Elections office in Hillsborough, Carrboro Town Hall, Chapel of the Cross at UNC, the Seymour Center in Chapel Hill and the Efland Ruritan Club. These polling stations will be open from 7 AM to 7 PM weekdays, 8 AM to 3 PM on Saturdays and 1 PM to 3 PM on Sundays, during the period of October 17 through November 3. Election day is Tuesday, November 6.
	
	A bill passed into law by the General Assembly in June requires that all sites, with the exception of county board of elections offices, must maintain the exact same schedule for the entire 17-day stretch of early voting.

	Duke&#x2019;s Student Affairs VP, Center of May's Rap Song Controversy, Retires&lt;/span&gt;(UNIVERSITY LIFE) &#x2014;  Duke University&#x2019;s vice president for student affairs, Larry Moneta, who was the focal point of a campus controversy over loud rap music this past May, has made public his plans to retire after 17 years of employment.
	
	Moneta made national headlines after an incident in which his personal complaint to the management of Duke&#x2019;s branch of Joe Van Gogh, a Triangle-based coffee chain, about a hip hop song titled &#x201C;Get Paid&#x201D; by the rapper Young Dolph being played on the store&#x2019;s sound system. The song includes sexually objectifying lyrics and vulgar language. Moneda&#x2019;s complaint resulted in two baristas losing their positions. 
	
	A controversy ensued almost immediately after multiple news outlets published the baristas&#x2019; own accounts of the episode, which said that no offense was intended, the music streaming station was changed promptly and Moneta was offered his products for free by way of apology. 
	
	Shortly after the story broke, Moneta was confronted in his office by a group of students blasting the song on a portable stereo as a form of protest, a video of which was posted online. For his part, Young Dolph (born Adolph Thornton Jr.) flew the former Joe Van Gogh workers to his Miami concert and gave them each $20,000. 
	
	Moneta&#x2019;s statement, posted on the Duke Today website, makes no reference to the incident and instead quotes him as saying, &#x201C;I never expected that I would complete my student affairs career here, and I&#x2019;m so very grateful to have had the opportunity to do so.&#x201D;    
	
	Moneta&#x2019;s responsibilities included overseeing student housing, dining, health and wellness, career services, student activities and cultural centers. He also spearheaded the renovation of the Broadhead Center, called the &#x201C;heart of Campus Center.&#x201D;
	
	Moneta&#x2019;s tenure will end with the 2018-2019 academic year. The university will begin a national search for his replacement in the fall.   </body>

    <title>Wake County Facilities Handled Cash Against Regulation, Audit Finds </title>
    <subhead></subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>WAKE COUNTY &#x2014; Wake County needs to ramp up employee oversight and recordkeeping when cash is handled at county registers, says an audit that stemmed from a $2.3 million shortfall discovered in January.
	
	Accounting firm Elliott Davis found &#x201C;deficiencies&#x201D; in 51 percent of Wake County&#x2013;run facilities handling cash management operations, according to an audit presented to county officials Monday, August 14.
	
	The audit was requested by the Wake County Board of Commissioners after $2.3 million was discovered missing from Wake County Register of Deeds funds in January. 
	
	The report was not intended to be a prescriptive fix, but an examination of the efficacy of cash management policies at the facilities, and of whether the rules were being followed by staffers. The auditors inspected all county facilities where cash transactions regularly take place, more than one hundred in total, to find the deficiencies. 
	
	The systemic problems, the audit found, included &#x201C;insufficient restrictions&#x201D; regarding cash storage at 46 percent of locations, meaning unauthorized employees had access to register drawers or safes at times when supervisors were not present to ensure proper conduct. 
	
	The audit also discovered that 44 percent of sites surveyed allowed cashiers to void various types of transactions in the process of granting refunds or fee waivers, without requiring a paper trail. The report indicated that this problem occurred primarily in county libraries, where cash exchanges are typically limited to late return fees of no more than a few dollars. 
	
	The audit presentation noted that current accounting guidelines need only proper enforcement, not necessarily adjustment, because as the code is now written, &#x201C;libraries [must-have a] designated manager on duty with responsibility to approve these adjustments.&#x201D;
	
	Another frequent county policy violation the audit discovered was that of retaining &#x201C;cash balances on hand overnight in excess of $250.&#x201D; Also, &#x201C;weekly or monthly deposits were not taking place as required per policy.&#x201D; The less money on hand, the presumption is, the less can disappear during any given shift. 
	
	Auditors conducted their inquiry from July 2017 through June 2018 at 104 Wake County locations.

	(COASTAL LIFE) &#x2014; A couple taking a stroll along the North Carolina coast spotted an unusual prehistoric fossilized megalodon tooth on Wrightsville Beach measuring almost four inches in length.  
	
	The tooth, found on August 14, could possibly date back to an animal living  2.6 million years ago or more.
	
	The megaladon was a species which most experts consider to be the largest shark discovered to date, having gone extinct in during the Pliocene period, well after the last species of dinosaur were wiped out during the Cretaceous-Palaeogene mass extinction event.  
	
	Scientists speculate the megaladon it may have looked similar to a great white shark or perhaps a sand Tiger shark.  
	
	Megalodons could easily reach lengths exceeding 60 feet.  By comparison, the largest great white ever reliably recorded measured 19.7 feet.
	
	While the couple&#x2019;s discovery is unusual, it is not the first time such paleontological treasures have washed up North Carolina shores.  In 2015, multiple vacationers uncovered a stash of ancient shark teeth likely brought to the coast by the strong seas of Hurricane Joaquin.    
	
	A picture of the Wrightsville Beach find was posted to the Internet shortly after its unearthing, revealing a palm-sized, jet-black specimen.  
	
	Only weeks prior to the Wrightsville Beach find, a team of Australian scientists found a stash of teeth once belonging to a close relative of the megalodon known as the narrow-tooth shark.

	(SCI &amp;amp; HEALTH) &#x2014; A three-person team from the Intensive Survey Branch of the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) detected traces of potentially dangerous algae blooms in Wake County&#x2019;s Falls Lake on Friday morning.  They were called to the area after passing driver reported a large patch of reddish discoloration on the lake surface late Thursday.  
	
	Residents who live in close proximity to Falls Lake claim that the unusual coloring was a first in their experience, although at least some algae is expected every year, with blooms spiking between May and August annually.  
	
	&#x201C;The algae may periodically use up oxygen in the water, killing fish,&#x201D; stated a information fact-sheet posted on DEQ website.  &#x201C;It can also affect other animals and people. The algae can cause skin irritation or respiratory irritation in people who get in the water or handle the algae.&#x201D;  
	
	In order to better alert the general public to where health threats may be lurking, the DEQ has also provided &lt;a href="https://deq.nc.gov/about/divisions/water-resources/water-resources-data/water-sciences-home-page/ecosystems-branch/algae-aquatic-plants/algal-bloom-events" target="_blank"&gt;an interactive map online&lt;/a&gt; where visitors can see the location of every algae bloom found between 2012 and 2017 in both Jordan Lake and Falls Lakes, the two primary sources of drinking water in the Triangle.
	
	The type of blue-green algae being found are clusters of lifeforms called cyanobacteria, which while are technically are considered to be toxic to both humans and animals. This spread of algae in Falls Lake is not reported to have caused any human injury. , have not caused any reported sickness in North Carolina.

Its run in Durham is planned  32 shows through December 2.  
	
	Tickets officially went on sale at 10 AM on Saturday, August 18, with lines forming outside DPAC as early as 7 AM despite the order of sale not being determined by one&#x2019;s place in line, but via random lottery drawings of 50-person lots.  DPAC season ticket holders were given first priority.  The box office allowed no phone sales for this first day, and customers arriving to purchase tickets for other DPAC events were asked to return on a different day.  
	
	The atmosphere turned carnivalesque once employees from Fullsteam Brewery arrived to distribute samples of their own craft beer for free to members of the ticket line.    
	
	Creator Lin-Manuel Miranda&#x2019;s musical was an unexpected success when it opened in 2015, and its innovative use of traditional Broadway orchestration and songwriting alongside hip hop and R&amp;amp;B numbers were considered a gamble by New York theater critics. 
	
	After its first production season the show set a record by being nominated for 16 Tony Awards, winning 11 of them.

    <title>'Silent Sam,' Statue of Confederate Soldier at UNC, Pulled Down by Protestors</title>
    <subhead></subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>CHAPEL HILL&#x2014; Punctuating an ongoing dispute over the continued presence of Confederate monuments on Southern university campuses, protestors Monday night at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill toppled &#x201C;Silent Sam,&#x201D; the statue of a Confederate infantryman. 
	
	No one was reported injured when the statue fell forward from its pedestal. The statue was covered with a piece of tarp by campus police later on Monday night. 
	
	Video of the event indicates that the head of the figure was severely damaged by the toppling&#x2019;s impact. 
	
	UNC Chancellor Carol Folt released a statement about the incident early Tuesday, the first day of the university&#x2019;s 2018 fall semester. 
	
	&#x201C;Last night&#x2019;s actions were unlawful and dangerous, and we are very fortunate that no one was injured,&#x201D; Chancellor Folt wrote. &#x201C;The police are investigating the vandalism and assessing the full extent of the damage.&#x201D;
	
	A campus security officer indicated that a person from the crowd had been arrested at or before the time Silent Sam was toppled. A crowd member said it appeared that the protestor had been arrested for wearing a mask, which a North Carolina law forbids anyone participating in a public demonstration from doing.
	
	Dedicated in 1913 and financed by the United Daughters of the Confederacy, the statue has been a point of sustained controversy in the post&#x2013;Civil Rights era, as well as a target of vandalism, most recently when graduate student Maya Little was arrested on April 30 for defacing it with red ink that she said was mixed with her own blood. 
	
	The toppling of Silent Sam was preceded on Monday by a rally meant to be a show of support for Little and her ongoing legal battle. About two hours into a rally that began at the Peace and Justice Plaza in front of Franklin Street&#x2019;s Old Post Office, protestors marched onto the UNC campus and approached the police who stood guard over the threatened monument. 
	
	UNC campus police then lost control of the north quad area around the statue, onlookers and media sources reported.
	
	Four tall banners were raised, and it was said later by some, but not all, witnesses that they were erected in order to create a perimeter and block Silent Sam from view. Minutes later, the century-old statue was on the ground, and reports conflicted over whether rope or straps or the cloth banners themselves were used to pull the bronze figure over.
	
	The governor&#x2019;s office commented shortly after Folt did, stating in a press release that Governor Roy Cooper understands &#x201C;that many people are frustrated by the pace of change and he shares their frustration, but violent destruction of public property has no place in our communities.&#x201D; 
	
	The statue&#x2019;s official name is Memorial to Civil War Soldiers of the University. Though the dedication on its plaque does not exclude University students who fought for the Union, the statue depicts a soldier in the uniform of a Confederate infantryman.
	
	The infantryman&#x2019;s figure holds a rifle and faced northward, but carries no ammunition box, which is said to be the deliberate choice of John Wilson, its Boston-based sculptor. The statue&#x2019;s nickname, Silent Sam, is a reference to his lack of ammunition.
	
	&#x201C;On the front of the monument a brass plaque depicts a woman clad in classical dress, representing North Carolina, resting her hand on the shoulder of a seated student, convincing him to take up arms,&#x201D; according to the statue&#x2019;s entry in &#x201C;Commemorative Landscapes of North Carolina,&#x201D; a project of DocSouth Data, a digital publishing project sponsored by UNC Libraries. 
	
	An inscribed plaque on the pedestal reads:
	
	TO THE SONS OF THE UNIVERSITY
	
	WHO ENTERED THE WAR OF 1861 - 65 
	
	IN ANSWER TO THE CALL OF THEIR 
	
	COUNTRY AND WHOSE LIVES 
	
	TAUGHT THE LESSON OF 
	
	THEIR GREAT COMMANDER THAT 
	
	DUTY IS THE SUBLIMEST WORD 
	
	IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE
	
	Rain beginning at 10 PM pelted a crowd that remained gathered around the now-empty pedestal on UNC&#x2019;s north campus quad known as McCorkle Place, soaking a group of onlookers, campus security officers and TV news crews taping reports of the incident.
	
	&#x201C;The person who erected it, Julian Carr, was a terrible white supremacist,&#x201D; said Tiz Giordano, who arrived with a friend shortly after 10:30 to view the scene.
	
	During his dedication speech for the statue in 1913, Julian Shakespeare Carr, Confederate veteran, mill owner and namesake of Carrboro, bragged of having physically assaulted a black woman in the streets of Chapel Hill &#x201C;because upon the streets of this quiet village she had publicly insulted and maligned a Southern lady, and then rushed for protection to these University buildings where was stationed a garrison of 100 Federal soldiers.&#x201D;
	
	Ella Carter said that she and her roommate were in their South Campus dorm Monday night when they learned from friends and social media about the toppling of the statue.
	
	&#x201C;My roommate and I heard about it 30 minutes after it took place and we just said, &#x2018;We&#x2019;re going.&#x2019;&#x201D;
	
	An incoming freshman with extended family ties to those who still own old plantation lands, Carter said she didn&#x2019;t agree with the ideals commemorated on Confederate monuments, and mentioned some of her discomforts over the legacy of Southern slavery &#x2014; for instance, black people whose family names come from the white families of their communities whose ancestors, by inference, may have once have been owned theirs.
	
	&#x201C;I&#x2019;ve been talking with my friends about this. I have a lot of UNC friends who were here last year [when] this was a big issue,&#x201D; Carter said.
	
	Kody Daley, an incoming UNC junior-year transfer, said he was aware of the recent controversies, including Little&#x2019;s act of civil disobedience in vandalizing the statue last year and a large and noisy rally of protestors numbering up to one thousand in the first week of the 2017 fall semester.
	
	 &#x201C;I heard about it as an issue,&#x201D; Daley said. &#x201C;I didn&#x2019;t know that it was reaching this kind of climax.&#x201D; </body>

    <title>Judges' Order Puts Midterm Ballots in Limbo </title>
    <subhead></subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>RALEIGH &#x2014; State ballots for the 2018 midterm elections are temporarily stalled from being printed, after a joint challenge in Wake County Superior Court challenged the validity of four &lt;a href="https://piedmontsundial.com/calendar/calendar_main_article.php?theArticle=149" target="_blank"&gt;proposed amendments&lt;/a&gt; to the North Carolina Constitution.
	
	A three-judge panel convened at the Wake County Courthouse on August 15 to preside over two separate hearings challenging four of the six proposed amendments to the state constitution slated for the midterm election ballot this November.
	
	At the adjournment of the afternoon session, judges Forrest Bridges, Thomas Lock and Jeffrey Carpenter conferred momentarily in chambers and returned to announce the delay of ballot printing until September 1, only weeks before the deadline of September 22 for having absentee ballots ready.
	
	The two hearings occurred during back-to-back hearings during the August 15 court sessions, the same three-judge panel presiding. Both hearings concerned items that Republican legislators in the North Carolina General Assembly have voted to include as constitutional amendment proposals on November's statewide midterm ballots. The two measures challenged in the morning would move political power from the governor's office to state legislators.&amp;nbsp;
	
	Governor Roy Cooper served as plaintiff for the first hearing, asking the court to grant a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction to block both the Boards and Elections Amendment and the Judicial Vacancies Amendment. 
	
	As written, the Boards and Elections Amendment would effectively strip the governorship of its power to appoint members to the Bipartisan State Board of Elections and Ethics Enforcement, instead turning that process entirely over to the General Assembly.
	
	 The Judicial Vacancies Amendment would task the legislature with forming a judicial commission that would share the responsibility of appointing judges to any seats opening midterm with the governor. That power is currently solely in the hands of the executive branch.
	
	The North Carolina chapter of the NAACP, as well as Clean Air Carolina, an environmental advocacy group based in Charlotte, acted as plaintiffs in the afternoon hearing. Lawyers for the two organizations made argued for a temporary restraining order and injunction on four amendments: the two mentioned prior as well as the Voter ID Amendment and Income Tax Cap Amendment. The first would require North Carolina residents to present photo ID to vote in future elections and the other would lower the state&#x2019;s personal income tax limit from 10 percent to 7 percent. 
	
	The primary justifications for seeking injunctive relief in both sessions were the same: that the current General Assembly is an illegal &#x201C;usurper body&#x201D; voted into office on the basis of racially gerrymandered districts that the United States Supreme Court has ruled unconstitutional, and that the amendments as written use language that is &#x201C;vague, incomplete and/or misleading,&#x201D; according to a memorandum by NAACP and Clean Air Carolina.
	
	In May of 2017, the federal Supreme Court ruled in a 5-3 decision for Cooper v. Harris that the first and 12th congressional districts relied too heavily on race when redrawn after the 2010 census. The General Assembly was ordered to remedy the districting prior to the 2018 midterm elections, leading to a new map only after a series of map proposals that were contested in lower court cases. 
	
	When the legislature voted on the six ballot amendments this summer, 72 percent of state senators and 68 percent of house members &#x201C;were from districts that have been redrawn to cure the unconstitutional gerrymander,&#x201D; according to the memorandum. 
	
	Lawyers working on behalf of state House Speaker Tim Moore, who served as the primary defendant in both sessions, argued against the &#x201C;usurper&#x201D; challenge by stating, &#x201C;Although the North Carolina General Assembly passed numerous laws in 2017 and 2018, plaintiffs cherry-picked four specific amendments in an attempt to circumvent the proscribed legislative process for the type of challenge they bring and to substitute their policy judgments for those of the General Assembly.&#x201D;
	
	Kym Hunter, an attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center who represented Clean Air Carolina in court, spoke to the Sundial on the question of amendment language, saying the wording of all four of the challenged proposals that would appear on voters' ballots is rife with confusion. For example, &#x201C;In the Boards and Elections Amendment for example, the ballot language says it will &#x2018;establish&#x2019; that board when it in fact already exists."
	
	There is also the issue of summarizing the multi-page amendments in understandable language.
	
	&#x201C;[The Boards and Elections Amendment] says it will clarify appointment authority for the legislature, but what it will actually do is completely change not just appointment authority over 350 boards and commissions, but their powers and duties as well, and move it from the governor to the legislature,&#x201D; Hunter said. &#x201C;That&#x2019;s a pretty big deal to not have that included in the ballot language.&#x201D; 
	
	Attorneys for the Republican leadership sought to rebuff the charge of misleading the public on voters' ballots by trying to argue that such is the nature of law and statute construction that its complexity and nuance can never fully be reduced to written language that is both complete and concise enough for a written ballot measure. 
	
	 
	
	According to Hunter, the SELC attorney, the judge&#x2019;s decision will buy enough time for Governor Cooper and other parties to &#x201C;appeal directly to the Supreme Court&#x201D; of North Carolina. </body>

    <title>ABC Wasted Millions With Maryland Firm, Audit Says</title>
    <subhead></subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>RALEIGH &#x2014; The North Carolina Office of the State Auditor released a report Thursday saying the North Carolina Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission (ABC) lost millions of dollars through the poor administration warehousing and distribution contracts with a Maryland-based logistics company.
	
	Lead investigator Beth Wood&#x2019;s report examined costs and contract with LB&amp;amp;B, a Columbia, Md.-based logistics company that handled the warehousing and distribution of liquors for sale through ABC to retail clients at ABC stores and at commercial clubs and restaurants in North Carolina.
	
	ABC did not act in the best interests of the state when it administered contracts with LB&amp;amp;B, the report stated.
	
	The audit found that contracts and unused warehouse rentals with LB&amp;amp;B resulted in a $11.3 million loss in state revenue over a 13-year period, and found that the state did not conduct its engagement with the contractor in accordance with state policies and best practices.
	
	The auditors found that the upkeep costs and property taxes of large amounts of unused warehouse spaces resulted in additional state losses of $2.1 million, and that questionable cost increases reported by LB&amp;amp;B that were used to justify higher payments to LB&amp;amp;B were not reviewed or challenged by the ABC's administrators.
	
	The audit&#x2019;s executive summary offered a series of recommendations to help recover from the ABC regulatory failures: &#x201C;The Commission should obtain the Division of Purchase &amp;amp; Contract&#x2019;s review and approval when the contract term, including extensions and renewals, will exceed three years,&#x201D; the document read. &#x201C;The Commission should review and validate the reasons given for all requested contract amendments and price increases prior to authorization.&#x201D;
	
	According to the company profile included on its official website, LB&amp;amp;B and Associates is a &#x201C;diversified services company operating in 25 states &#x2026;[providing] a variety of contract services for the U.S. Government and commercial entities.&#x201D;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
	
	In 2015, LB&amp;amp;B was fined $7.8 million for making &#x201C;false statements to obtain contracts through the Small Business Administration&#x2019;s Business Development Program,&#x201D; according to a U.S. Department of Justice press release.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;
	
	Brad Young, the Director of External Affairs for the State Auditor&#x2018;s office, who spoke by phone to the Sundial, said his office was looking for irregularities in contract enforcement.
	
	&#x201C;Our offices auditors looked a the DPS, which is what ABC falls under, and noticed that there were issues with that contract and it was something we needed to address.&#x201D;
	
	The inquiry was not prompted by a suspicion of wrongdoing by any department, rather &#x201C;there was a directive from the General Assembly a few years ago for our office to look at the &#x2018;Big Six&#x2019; state agencies to gather an understanding of their financials on an agency-by-agency basis, rather than an overall examination at a very high level like the state currently has done,&#x201D; he said.&amp;nbsp;
	
	The "Big Six" North Carolina agencies Young referred to are the NC Department of Transportation, the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), the Department of Public Instruction (DPI), the Department of Public Safety (DPDS),&amp;nbsp; the Department of State Treasurer (DST), and the Department of Commerce (DOC).&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
	
	&#x201C;We said, Okay, you [ABC] have a [contract] amendment and there&#x2019;s this spike in price that&#x2019;s above what would be allowed in the contract, so what would be the justification behind that?&#x201D; Young said.
	
	&#x201C;And [ABC] would come back and say, 'Well, we requested an increase in price because of fuel costs that year.' So, we want justification on that, and when we saw gaps in the paperwork, that is what added up to that $11.3 million figure.&#x201D;
	
	Young clarified that his office has not participated in any forensic accounting that might uncover criminal bookkeeping practices, and emphasized that they are not empowered by the state to enforce their prescriptive guidelines. Such measures would be within the purview of the State Bureau of Investigation or the General Assembly.</body>

    <title>With Assist From Private DNA Lab, Arrest in '06-'08 Sex Assaults</title>
    <subhead></subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>FAYETTEVILLE &#x2014; Fayetteville police arrested a man in connection with a series of six sexual assaults occurring between 2006 and 2008 which earned the perpetrator a media nickname, the &#x201C;Ramsey Street Rapist.&#x201D; 
	
	The suspect, a resident of Linden, was being held without bond Friday and was identified by officials at a press conference on Wednesday, August 22. 
	
	&#x201C;This individual has been in our community, walking around our streets for the last 10 years, probably smirking, thinking he got away with this,&#x201D; said Cumberland County District Attorney Billy West. &#x201C;Well, he didn&#x2019;t.&#x201D;
	
	Also speaking to media was Fayetteville Police Lt. John Somerindyke, who explained how, after a decade of no investigative results, detectives sought the assistance Parabon NanoLabs, a Virginia-based DNA technology company for both therapeutic and forensic purposes. Parabon tested crime scene evidence with DNA for certain markers for clues about the suspect. 
	
	The database used to identify the "Ramsey Street Rapist" suspect is one of a number of privately run genealogy databases that have been cooperating with law enforcement across the country in a collaborative attempt to finally close a host of cold cases. These companies hold repositories of voluntarily collected genetic information that can be used to pin down a perpetrator&#x2019;s location through both living and deceased relatives. 
	
	Parabon was &#x201C;able to triangulate and figure out a strong person of interest for us,&#x201D; Somerindyke said. The suspect was matched later when detectives were able to collect his personal DNA and test it against the evidentiary material. 
	
	This same technique recently made headlines after California&#x2019;s Joseph James DeAngelo was charged as the alleged, elusive Golden State Killer in April of this year, a breakthrough in a string of murder and rape cases that for up to four decades had remained unsolved. </body>

    <title>Confederate Monuments Will Remain at Capitol Despite Governor&#x2019;s Request </title>
    <subhead></subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>RALEIGH &#x2014; The North Carolina State Historical Commission voted to keep three Confederate monuments in their current capitol grounds locations on Wednesday, August 22. The commission also ordered the addition of public information at the sites,contextualizing the realities of slavery, Civil Rights movements and the Jim Crow era, when many of the state&#x2019;s Confederate memorials were built and erected. 
	
	The three monuments ruled upon Wednesday are: the Capitol Confederate Monument, dedicated in May 1895; the Henry Lawson Wyatt Monument, dedicated in June 1912; and the North Carolina Confederacy Monument, dedicated in June 1914. 
	
	Henry Lawson Wyatt was the first North Carolina soldier killed in battle in the Civil War. The Capital Confederate Monument, the oldest of the three at 123 years of age, was built 30 years after the end of the Civil War.
	
	The NCSHC, which is made up of professional and amateur historians, was responding to a request by Governor Roy Cooper to consider moving the monuments to the government-maintained Bentonville Battlefield State Historic Site in Four Oaks, 45 miles from Raleigh. That location was chosen partly to comply with the office of the North Carolina Attorney General&#x2019;s Office, which announced in May that the commission&#x2019;s power to move such edifices was limited to the interests of their preservation for posterity.
	
	The commission acknowledged that current Capitol monuments are imbalanced in their recognition of the Confederate cause, against recognition of the damage brought to the victims of slavery and Jim Crow racism. 
	
	The Historical Commission&#x2019;s decision came about 36 hours after a group of protestors at UNC-Chapel Hill overturned the Confederate statue &#x201C;Silent Sam,&#x201D; and close to one year after a Confederate Soldier sculpture in downtown Durham was illegally toppled.

    <body>News and Notes from the Piedmont and Triangle.
	
	&lt;br&gt;
	
	&lt;b&gt;State News &lt;/b&gt;
	
	(POLITICS) &#x2014; A federal judge has ruled that a recently expanded piece of North Carolina legislation, known as the &#x201C;sore loser&#x201D; law, cannot be applied to three candidates who sued to appear on November ballots as members of the Constitution Party of North Carolina. 
	
	The candidates, who did not win primary races in which they competed to be a mainstream party&#x2019;s nominee, sued after being barred from running in November&#x2019;s general election as members of the newly-minted Constitution Party.  
	
	The &#x201C;sore loser law&#x201D; passed through the North Carolina General Assembly in early June, and was enacted over a veto. The law is written to block any candidates defeated in a primary from continuing to seek the same office as a member of a different political party.  
	
	The Constitution Party of North Carolina was not officially recognized until more than a month after primary elections were held. It became a recognized party in June.
	
	The three plaintiffs, candidates for office as Constitution Party of North Carolina members, had lost May primary bids in Republican and Democratic races before switching their affiliations to the Constitution Party. 
	
	 
	
	Their status as active candidates was contested by the N.C. Board of Elections and Ethics Enforcement, which ultimately failed to persuade U.S. District Judge Louise Flanagan.  
	
	Victorious in their lawsuit, and campaigning as members of the state&#x2019;s newly recognized political party, are James Allen Poindexter, Jerry Jones and Gregory Holt. 
	
	Poindexter ran in the Republican primary race for the North Carolina House of Representatives in District 90 (covering Surry County and part of Wilkes County). Jones and Holt ran in primary elections for county commission seats, Jones as a Democrat in Greene County, and Holt as a Republican in Craven County.
	
	The Constitution Party of North Carolina became a state-recognized political party on June 6. It did not run primary elections, but selected its candidates via nominating convention. 
	
	The Constitution Party&#x2019;s platform, which is &lt;a href="http://www.constitutionpartync.com/state-party-platform/" target="_blank"&gt;available&lt;/a&gt; on its website, is characterized by traditionally conservative stances and issues.
	
	The North Carolina General Assembly included the &#x201C;sore loser&#x201D; provision in legislation passed in early June, and on June 20 voted to override Governor Roy Cooper&#x2019;s veto of its election legislation. 
	
	Flanagan made it clear in her decision that &#x201C;sore loser&#x201D; laws are not categorically unlawful, and that their application may sometimes be a boon to the democratic process, but &#x201C;the retroactive application and impact of this law on plaintiffs&#x2019; rights&#x201D; (wrote Flanagan in her ruling) convinced her to issue a preliminary injunction in the candidates&#x2019; favor. 
	
	The injunction can be appealed, but the Board of Elections and Ethics Enforcement has not announced plans to pursue that course. 
	
	As the final date for ballot wording nears, it appears likely that the three candidates, one running for a state House seat and two for county commission seats, will see their names printed alongside their major-party opponents on election day and absentee ballots on November 6.

	&lt;b&gt;Orange County&lt;/b&gt;
	
	(UNIVERSITY LIFE) &#x2014; Seven arrests were made on the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill campus on Saturday, August 25 as taunts and minor brawling between opposing activist groups broke out near the now-empty pedestal where the controversial Silent Sam statue stood for over a century from June of 1913 until this past week.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;
	
	On Friday, four days after a &lt;a href="https://piedmontsundial.com/calendar/calendar_main_article.php?theArticle=158" target="_blank"&gt;group of protestors pulled down&lt;/a&gt; the statue of a Confederate infantryman from its pedestal (UNC has removed the figure from where it fell), rumors began circulating on campus and throughout the community that a right-wing organization known as The Oath Keepers was planning a counter-demonstration on McCorkle Place the following morning to voice their disapproval of the monument&#x2019;s displacement.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
	
	UNC chancellor Carol Folt issued a statement asking students and other town residents to stay away from the area for the duration of the demonstration.&lt;br&gt;
	
	According to its website, The Oath Keepers &#x201C;is a non-partisan association of current and formerly serving military, police, and first responders, who pledge to fulfill the oath all military and police take to &#x2018;defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic.&#x2019;&#x201D;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
	
	The Southern Poverty Law Center categorizes the group's ideology as &#x201C;anti-government.&#x201D;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
	
	According to university officials, none of the arrests involved individuals associated with the school.&amp;nbsp; Folt told reporters that, of those detained on Saturday, three were arrested for assault; one for property destruction; one for resisting an officer; and two for assault, destruction of property and inciting a riot.&amp;nbsp; All seven arrests occurred before 12:45 PM.
	
	Two days prior to these events, on Thursday, August 23, UNC Board of Governors member Thom Goolsby posted a video of himself online promising Silent Sam&#x2019;s return to campus within 90 days, as is required by NC General Statute 100-2.1.
	
	&#x201C;We will not allow anarchy to reign on our campus,&#x201D; Goolsby said.&amp;nbsp; &#x201C;We will do all we can to see that the rule of law is enforced.&#x201D;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;</body>

	&lt;br&gt;
	
	&lt;b&gt;Orange County&lt;/b&gt;
	
	(LAW ENFORCEMENT) &#x2014; The Carrboro Police Department warned community residents on Friday, August 24 about a series of vehicle break-ins that occurred &#x201C;during the overnight hours.&#x201D; No specific dates were made public in the statement.
	
	The investigation has detectives inquiring into &#x201C;48 vehicle break-ins, multiple larcenies from vehicle incidents, and three larceny of vehicle incidents&#x201D; that took place across the whole town.
	
	The statement continued, &#x201C;there is no evidence that force was used to enter vehicles and it appears that most of the vehicles involved were left unlocked.&#x201D;
	
	The three stolen vehicles reportedly had keys left in them while also being unlocked. Only one vehicle has been recovered as of publication.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
	
	Those living in or close to the town with home video security systems installed near their vehicles have been asked to review footage for robbery attempts and immediately bring incriminating evidence to authorities.
	
	Police have also advised all residents to remove valuables, including their keys, from inside vehicles, especially in the evening.
	
	In an email sent to the Sundial from Captain Chris Atack of Carrboro PD, he explained that with the investigation currently ongoing, detectives were unwilling to speculate on whether the break-ins were gang-related, &#x201C;but it certainly appears that it was an organized effort.&#x201D;
	
	Captain Joshua Mecimore of the Chapel Hill Police Department said it was possible that multiple incidents of larceny from unlocked vehicles that occurred on the same night near the Chapel Hill&#x2013;Carrboro border night were committed by the same person or group. &#x201C;Criminals rarely consider geographical boundaries,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;But we had nowhere near the same numbers as Carrboro.&#x201D;
	
	Anyone with information on these crimes may call CrimeStoppers at (919) 942-7515 or the Carrboro Police Department at (919) 918-7397.

	&lt;b&gt;Durham County&lt;/b&gt;
	
	(UNIVERSITY LIFE) &#x2014; Students at Duke University were sent an email by school president Vincent Price that said campus police were investigating the defacement of a sign for the Mary Lou Williams Center for Black Culture with a racial epithet.
	
	The epithet, described as the &#x201C;N-word,&#x201D; was discovered by students on Saturday, August 25 near the Flowers Building on West Campus. Duke officials covered the sign until it can be properly cleaned and redisplayed.
	
	&#x201C;While we can&#x2019;t undo or unsee this painful assault on our right to live and study in a civil and respectful environment, we can and do promise that odious acts like this will be acknowledged and challenged at every opportunity,&#x201D; Price stated in his email. &#x201C;Especially at a time when some seek deliberately to provoke hatred and distrust.&#x201D;
	
	The Mary Lou Williams Center for Black Culture, named in honor of the former Duke professor and acclaimed pianist and composer, was established in 1983. According to a Duke University brochure, the center&#x2019;s mission includes fostering &#x201C;an appreciation for and increase knowledge of the peoples, histories, and cultures of the African diaspora and its many contributions to the world.&#x201D;
	
	Price beseeched his fellow students to not succumb to provocation and not to allow the incident to divide them. &#x201C;Let us use this moment to come together in support of our fellow students, faculty or staff who are so maligned,&#x201D; Price&#x2019;s statement said. &#x201C;Let us reaffirm and act upon our commitments to inclusion, tolerance and respect.&#x201D;

	&lt;b&gt;State News&lt;/b&gt;
	
	(LAW ENFORCEMENT) &#x2014;North Carolina&#x2019;s Alcohol Law Enforcement (ALE), a branch of the State Bureau of Investigation, has arrested 226 people in the course of a multi-county operational crackdown with the goal of preventing &#x201C;violence and other criminal activity at locations that sell alcoholic beverages,&#x201D; on August 24.
	
	The 14 counties in which arrests were made were Jackson, Pitt, Wake, Orange, Durham, Forsyth, Madison, Cumberland, Alamance, Buncombe, Mecklenburg, Iredell, Catawba and New Hanover. The operation made use of 109 &#x201C;specially trained&#x201D; ALE agents who have the power to conduct investigations as well as detain suspects.
	
	A total of 382 charges were filed, with 141 related to the distribution of alcoholic beverages and 134 related to the possession or sale of illegal drugs. Agents documented regulatory violations at 13 commercial establishments that hold up-to-date permits from the Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission. Other arrests were made at &#x201C;non-permitted locations, such as illegal bars.&#x201D;
	
	The State Bureau of Investation, which manages ALE, said in their press release that the crackdown was connected to two incidents involving the discharge of firearms.
	
	Agents conducting arrests in Fayetteville &#x201C;intervened during a shooting following a disturbance outside a Food Lion on Rosehill Road and provided medical aid to the shooting victim until EMS arrived.&#x201D; The incident was unrelated to the arrests.
	
	The second incident occurred in Charlotte, at Tropix Bar &amp;amp; Lounge. A disturbance began inside then moved to the parking lot, where a suspect got into a vehicle and sped into a Homeland Security agent accompanying the ALE agents. The federal agent fired on the suspect; no other officers fired. The incident is still under investigation.
	
	Other organizations that participated in the operation include the State Highway Patrol, the Division of Motor Vehicles License and Theft Bureau, N.C. Wildlife Resource Officers and U.S. Homeland Security Investigations, as well as &#x201C;county sheriff&#x2019;s offices, municipal police departments, and other law enforcement partners.&#x201D;
	
	Captain Mecimore of the Chapel Hill Police Department was unaware of any attempts to coordinate with his officers on the part of ALE. &#x201C;We do our own alcohol law enforcement operations,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;I have not seen that press release, but as far as I know there were no arrests made here [by Chapel Hill Police].&#x201D;
	
	Upon request, however, SBI spokesperson Patty McQuillan provided statistics indicating that 24 arrests were made in Chapel Hill alone, amounting to 34 charges filed with the clerk of court.
	
	A follow-up inquiry to SBI asking why the Chapel Hill Police Department was left out of the loop had not been responded to at time of publication.</body>

    <title>Amendment Proposals Energize Democrats in Ramp Up to Midterms</title>
    <subhead></subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>&lt;div&gt;CARRBORO &#x2014; The Orange County Democratic Party is making a push to register voters for the November midterms, in a county that historically has favored the Democratic ticket.&amp;nbsp;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the same time, the party is pushing another message: for voters to reject each of the proposed amendments to the North Carolina Constitution set to appear the November 6 midterm elections ballot.&amp;nbsp;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#x201C;The official position of the Orange County Democratic Party is that we are against all of the amendments to the North Carolina Constitution,&#x201D; said Orange County Democratic Party Chairman Jim Bartow.&amp;nbsp;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;The proposed constitutional amendments have been put to a statewide referendum via legislation passed by Republican majorities in the North Carolina General Assembly.&amp;nbsp;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rancor over proposed amendments, some of which have been contested in North Carolina&#x2019;s courts, has excited the efforts of political parties in Orange County, manifest in political signs and at voter registration tables, in a season where politics is as thick in the air as the humidity. Ranked 20th in the state by population, Orange County is oversized where it comes to community involvement and activism.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#x201C;The founding fathers did not vote on the [United States] Constitution without knowing what was in it and neither should we,&#x201D; said Bartow, referencing proposed ballot language that Democrats have alleged to be confusing or misleading. &#x201C;You really don&#x2019;t want to put legislation in the constitution because if it isn&#x2019;t quite right, you can&#x2019;t fix it.&#x201D;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Orange County Democrats have set up booths at UNC Medical Center and the Carrboro Farmer&#x2019;s Market where volunteers give out a printout of the summarized amendments.&amp;nbsp;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Volunteers also make sure residents are registered in this county and that they know where to vote for early voting and Election Day voting. &lt;br&gt;At the Carrboro Farmer&#x2019;s Market on August 11, several volunteers were talking to people who had stopped by. To keep partisan politics out of the registration process, the volunteers did not expound on the amendments issue; in other words, they won&#x2019;t tell you how to vote.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to the Orange County Board of Elections, any group or political party may register voters and does not need to remain nonpartisan when doing so.&amp;nbsp;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Orange County Democratic Party voter registration coordinator Janet Zelman said, &#x201C;We have covered a lot of ground and are now working with the NAACP&#x2026; They are going to register voters too.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#x201C;We did the Chapel Hill Farmer&#x2019;s Market last week, and tomorrow we are going to the Weaver Street Market in Southern Village,&#x201D; Zelman said. &#x201C;And we will be at Festifall in Chapel Hill [October 7] and Hog Day in Hillsborough [September 14 and 15].&#x201D;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;A printout offered at registration tables is a page full of information about the proposed amendments to the state&#x2019;s constitution. The printout tells readers that the amendments are at the bottom of the last page of the ballot, and it includes a layperson&#x2019;s explanation of what they all mean.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;The printout was made by a get-out-the-vote organization You Can Vote, which is funded by The People&#x2019;s Alliance Fund. According to its website, The People&#x2019;s Alliance Fund is a non-profit 501(c)(3) that supports progressive education and research activities in Durham and other North Carolina communities.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;As she handed out another flyer on the amendments, Zelman said, &#x201C;We think that voter registration is a fundamental act of democracy because that gives people the access to vote.&#x201D;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Carlton McKee, a member of the county elections board, said Orange County had 113,444 registered voters on the date in August when the Piedmont Sundial interviewed him. Last year, Orange County had a total of 111,738 registered voters, which McKee explains is more typical of the county.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#x201C;When the students leave, they will do a change of address and those numbers will go down until the new students come. It [the number of registered voters] doesn&#x2019;t deviate much from 111,000,&#x201D; McKee said. &#x201C;Or at least it hasn&#x2019;t in years past.&#x201D;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Orange County always has a surge of voter registration around elections and UNC-Chapel Hill, according to the Orange County Board of Elections.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#x201C;With the students coming back in to town, they will keep rolling in,&#x201D; said Carlton McKee of the county Board of Elections.&lt;br&gt;&#x201C;We are committed to making sure that everyone that is eligible [to vote] is registered,&#x201D; Zelman said.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Democratic Party voter drives are not the only hurdle the constitutional amendment ballot measures will face. Governor Roy Cooper has petitioned North Carolina&#x2019;s courts for injunctive relief, contending that questions on the ballots were written to be purposefully misleading. &lt;br&gt;A panel of judges recently upheld Cooper&#x2019;s arguments and granted an injunction; no sooner had that decision come through than the North Carolina General Assembly legislated a change in the wording of contested amendment questions, which the governor again challenged.&amp;nbsp;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Orange County Democrats seek also in November to reelect incumbent David Price to the U.S. House of Representatives against his Republican opponent, Steve Von Loor and Libertarian candidate Barbara Howe, and to retain seats in the North Carolina General Assembly held by Democrats Verla Insko, Graig Meyer and Valerie P. Foushee.&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;&lt;br&gt;Summary of 2018 North Carolina Constitutional Amendment Proposals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;(By Piedmont Sundial news staff)&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;1. The North Carolina Right to Hunt and Fish Amendment: If passed, this proposal would amend Article I of the North Carolina Constitution, enshrining a right to make use of so-called "traditional" methods of hunting, fishing and harvesting state wildlife. The amendment would place the right to regulate hunting and fishing in North Carolina exclusively under the state's General Assembly (still subject to federal protections, but eliminating local control). This proposal would add North Carolina to a list of 21 other states with similar constitutional provisions.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;2. The North Carolina Marsy's Law Crime Victims Rights Amendment: Passage of this proposal would grant future victims of crime a list of guaranteed rights. These include a right to timely notice of court proceedings; to be reasonably heard at court proceedings; to be present at most proceedings; to timely restitution; to receive accurate information regarding court proceedings; to be notified upon the escape, release, or paroling of the accused; and to present views or concerns to the governor or proper state agency. This proposal is part of a national campaign named for 1983 California murder victim Marsalee Nicholas. As it stands, six states have passed a version of a Marsy&#x2019;s Law and none have been defeated at the ballot box.&amp;nbsp;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;3. The North Carolina Legislative Appointments to Elections: Board and Commissions Amendment: an affirmative vote to the first of two politically charged proposals would mean the governorship would be stripped of the power to appoint any of the Bipartisan State Board of Elections &amp;amp; Ethics Enforcement members.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;In 2017, the General Assembly passed a law that dissolved the North Carolina Ethics Commission and the State Elections Board, a second attempt at combining the two bodies after a court ruling overturned a similar law passed by the General Assembly in 2016. A ruling by the North Carolina Supreme Court in 2018 upheld the 2017 law, but denied the General Assembly's attempt to shift the power of appointments from North Carolina's governor to state legislators.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;The new board has nine members, eight of whom are currently selected by the governor. This proposal has grown out of the conflict between Democratic Governor Roy Cooper and the Republican-controlled General Assembly, with each side accusing the other in court of unconstitutional behavior. This amendment, if it were to pass, would shift all appointment decisions of the new regulatory body responsible for the administration of elections enforcement and ethics oversight in the hands of the legislature. Four of the eight board members would be chosen by the Senate and four by the House, and no more than four members could be registered with a single political party.&amp;nbsp;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;4. The North Carolina Judicial Selection for Midterm Vacancies Amendment: Another product of the state government&#x2019;s partisan polarization, an affirmative vote here would mean that judicial vacancies occurring between state court elections would no longer be filled by the governor's appointees.&amp;nbsp;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;Instead, a new process would be instituted involving the creation of a judicial commission to select a list of candidates that would then be narrowed down to two by the General Assembly. The Governor would then pick the nominee from the list of two. The commission members would be chosen by the General Assembly, the supreme court chief justice and the governor. The process by which the appointments are made would be set by statute. There would be a 10-day window for the governor&#x2019;s appointment, and if the governor failed to act, then the legislature would have the power to make the appointment.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;5. The North Carolina Income Tax Cap Amendment: The passage of this amendment would amend Section 2, Article V of the constitution to lower the maximum state income tax rate from 10 percent to 7 percent. The current personal income tax rate is 5.499 percent.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;6. The North Carolina Voter ID Amendment: If passed, this proposal would require any North Carolina voter who votes in person to present a valid photo identification. The proposal does not specify what forms of ID would be acceptable; details would be worked out by state lawmakers after passage.&amp;nbsp;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;In 2013, the United States Supreme Court decision in Shelby County v. Holder invalidated Section 4(b) of the 1965 Voting Rights Act, which had prevented some states &#x2014; specifically, those with low voter registration and/or tests for voting in certain tracked years, mostly southern states &#x2014; from changing their voting laws without first seeking federal approval.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;</body>

    <title>Cooper Loses Bid to Drop Amendments from November Ballot</title>
    <subhead></subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>UPDATE: THE NORTH CAROLINA SUPREME COURT HAS REJECTED THE GOVERNOR&#x2019;S APPEAL OF THE RULING DESCRIBED IN THIS ARTICLE.
	
	RALEIGH &#x2014; Governor Roy Cooper lost his bid to remove two contested state constitution amendment proposals from the general election ballot in Wake County Superior Court on Friday. 
	
	The state&#x2019;s solicitor general, Matthew Sawchak, argued before a three-judge panel at Friday&#x2019;s hearing that the proposals that would appear on November 6 ballots were misleading, despite their having been rewritten after the same panel of judges granted Cooper a preliminary injunction on August 21. The panel was made up of Forrest Bridges, Thomas Lock and Jeffery Carpenter.
	
	The judges ruled that the ballot&#x2019;s summary of an amendment that would reduce the governor&#x2019;s say in appointments to a reduced bipartisan Board of Ethics and Elections Enforcement, as rewritten after the judges&#x2019; previous ruling, &#x201C;may not be the most detailed description of the purpose and effect of the amendment, [but] we do not find that the language in this Ballot Question is so misleading so as to violate ... constitutional requirements.&#x201D;
	
	The court ruled similarly on the second contested ballot question, which strips North Carolina&#x2019;s governor of the power to appoint a replacement to the North Carolina Supreme Court when a vacancy opens up between regular elections for seats on the state&#x2019;s highest court.
	
	&#x201C;While the language may not be the most accurate or articulate description of the purpose and effect of these provisions, we do not find the language in this Ballot Question is so misleading as to violate the constitutional requirements explained in our August 21, 2018 order,&#x201D; the panel determined.
	
	Cooper&#x2019;s legal team had stated its intention to prepare an appeal to the North Carolina Supreme Court. The court&#x2019;s order includes a provision that the matter be subject to immediate appeal to the supreme court, &#x201C;in view of the fact that counsel for all parties have candidly expressed a likelihood that ANY decision of this panel in this case will be appealed.&#x201D;
	
	The two amendments in question, two of six questions slated for November&#x2019;s ballot that would change the North Carolina Constitution, would strip the governor&#x2019;s office of its power to make both midterm judicial appointments and appointments to the Board of Elections and Ethics Enforcement (BEEE). 
	
	The second amendment proposal would also reduce BEEE membership from nine to eight by eliminating a tiebreaker position meant to resolve deadlock votes, which could easily occur down party lines.
	
	&#x201C;Although the New Ballot Questions omit some of the most egregious aspects of the Original Ballot Questions,&#x201D; Cooper&#x2019;s brief read, &#x201C;the New Ballot Questions are still unconstitutional.&#x201D;
	
	Included in the motion filed by the governor and his attorneys was the expert testimony of Dr. Craig Burnett, a professor of political science at Hofstra University in New York, who previously taught at UNC-Wilmington and Appalachian State University in Boone. 
	
	Burnett was asked to comment on word choice in the revamped ballot proposals, which passed through the General Assembly on Monday, August 27. For example, the judicial appointment ballot question describes the amendment implementing &#x201C;a nonpartisan merit-based system that relies on professional qualifications&#x201D; and the elections board ballot question describes the amendment establishing &#x201C;a bipartisan Board of Ethics and Elections.&#x201D; 
	
	&#x201C;Voters will undoubtedly read this description as a reform-minded amendment, as the text implies that the current process of choosing individuals to fill judicial vacancies is one wrought with &#x2018;political influence,&#x2019;&#x201D; Burnett testified. &#x201C;These positive terms and phrases in these ballot questions will cause voters to be more likely to support this measure.&#x201D; 
	
	The General Assembly wrote legislation that could have achieved the same restriction of the Governor&#x2019;s BEEE appointment privileges without input from the electorate, but a 4-3 decision in the state supreme court determined the bill to be unconstitutional. Now, the changes seek to be part of the constitution.
	
	Attorneys for Cooper argued Friday that the majority of the voting public will in all likelihood be ignorant of this legal history, as ballot language does not normally provide such contextual information. 
	
	Attorney Martin Wharf, who represented Senate President Phil Berger and House Speaker Tim Moore at the hearing, responded to this line of argument by explaining that amendment proposals are not required to furnish a list of precedents, and only must succinctly explain the law as it would be implemented. 
	
	&#x201C;Everything about this process is right here in the ballot question,&#x201D; said Wharf. &#x201C;The people of North Carolina can decide for themselves whether they want this change.&#x201D;
	
	Sawchak told the court that he remained concerned. &#x201D;These ballot questions fail the standards &#x2026; and the hour is certainly growing late for this controversy.&#x201D; 
	
	After a 30-minute recess, the panel issued its decision. The plaintiffs voiced their intention to appeal to the North Carolina Supreme Court the same day.

    <title>NC Rail Upkeep Will Limit Amtrak Service in September</title>
    <subhead></subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>NORTH CAROLINA&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;"&gt;&#x2014;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;Amtrak announced that multiple train lines through North Carolina will be required to offer limited service and that the national passenger rail service will cancel some of its regular routes between September 10 and September 19 in order for workers to replace track on curves between the Greensboro and Selma Union Depot stops.
	
	The two most heavily trafficked lines affected by the work will be the Piedmont Line, which runs from Raleigh to Charlotte, and the Carolinian Line, which runs from Charlotte up the east coast to New York. Both will see all trips cancelled on Monday, September 17 so workers can connect the main line to a new track set to open at the recently constructed Raleigh station. This will allow both sides of the new platform to be completely operational.  
	
	Additional cancellations during the nine-day period will allow engineers to address the replacement of curved rails between Greensboro and Selma. The majority of this work will be overseen by the Norfolk Southern Corporation, which is responsible for the upkeep of 26,300 miles of railway across the eastern half of the United States. 
	
	The schedule announced by the North Carolina Department of Transportation is as follows:
	
	* September 10 through September 13: Carolinian line numbers 79 and 80 will run only between Charlotte and Raleigh.
	
	* September 16: The Silver Star line No. 92 will leave Miami headed north two hours and 45 minutes ahead of schedule. This might affect arrival times in Cary and Raleigh the next morning.
	
	* September 17: All Carolinian and Piedmont trains will be canceled. Train No. 91 of the southbound Silver Star line from New York to Florida will operate without delays or changes.
	
	* September 18: Carolinian line numbers 79 and 80 will operate with service between Charlotte and Raleigh only.
	
	* Sept. 19: Piedmont line numbers 74 and 75 between Charlotte and Raleigh will be canceled.</body>

    <title>Jellyfish Stings Kill Seaside Buzz off Outer Banks</title>
    <subhead></subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>OUTER BANKS&amp;nbsp; &#x2014; Pine Knoll Shores, a small beach community on North Carolina&#x2019;s Outer Banks, attracts many summer tourists every year, but swimmers met a few unwelcome visitors in the waters over Labor Day weekend.
	
	Labor Day weekend saw a rash of jellyfish stings reported, prompting a series of public safety announcements from state and local emergency workers via social media. 
	
	Fire Chief Jason Baker authored an information-dense Facebook post addressing the concerns of holiday bathers. His first words of advice included the unambiguous statement, &#x201C;If you are stung, call 911.&#x201D; 
	
	&#x201C;Vinegar will NOT stop the sting,&#x201D; Baker posted, &#x201C;it just stops the tentacle from &#x2018;firing&#x2019; its stingers anymore so the tentacle can be removed without causing further pain.&#x201D; 
	
	Baker&#x2019;s Facebook post continued, &#x201C;While most folks do not carry vinegar as a standard item to the beach, we have plenty on the ambulance and are happy to come out and assist at any time. We can take a look at the sting and advise from there.&#x201D;  
	
	Jellyfish (a type of gelatinous, tentacled invertebrate of the subphylum Medusozoa) are known to visit the waters off North Carolina&#x2019;s coastline. Species include the potentially fatal box jellyfish, the somewhat toxic purple sail jellyfish, the luminescent-when-threatened sea walnut and the mushroom jellyfish. Reports of additional species have occurred over the years, though with less frequency, including the venomous &#x201C;Portuguese Man O&#x2019; War&#x201D; &#x2014; not a true jellyfish, but a type of siphonophore. 
	
	The Red Cross&#x2019; website offers a list of directions for those who encounter the marine animals, or who are attempting to assist others in need of immediate treatment. The instructions include &#x201C;irrigate the injured part with large amounts of vinegar as soon as possible for at least 30 seconds,&#x201D; and &#x201C;Do not rub the wound, apply a pressure immobilization bandage or apply fresh water or other remedies because this may increase pain.&#x201D;
	
	All scientific sources emphasize that some individuals who make contact with jellyfish will experience a profound allergic reaction, which may lead to permanent paralysis or, in rarer cases death. Professional medical treatment is necessary to prevent the escalation of symptoms. </body>

    <title>Florence's Approach Prompts State of Emergency, Coastal Hurricane Warnings</title>
    <subhead></subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>&lt;i&gt;UPDATE: Hurricane Florence was upgraded to a Category 4 hurricane on Monday.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;As of 5PM Monday,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Florence's storm eye was at a point approximately 533 miles southeast of Bermuda, according to an announcement from the National Hurricane Center. Coastal landfall was estimated by the National Weather Service to come between Wednesday evening and Thursday morning.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;
	
	(NORTH CAROLINA) &#x2014; The National Hurricane Center, a division of the federal National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, issued a public advisory bulletin Sunday morning as a preliminary precaution, as Tropical Storm Florence (then still several hundred miles off the East Coast) intensified into a Category 1 hurricane as maximum sustained winds have surpassed 75 miles per hour.&lt;br&gt;
	
	&#x201C;Florence is forecast to rapidly strengthen to a major hurricane by Monday, and is expected to remain an extremely dangerous major hurricane through Thursday,&#x201D; the statement reads. &#x201C;Swells generated by Florence are affecting Bermuda and are beginning to reach portions of the U.S. East Coast. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.&#x201D;
	
	North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper declared a state of emergency on Friday, September 7 in a press release. &#x201C;While it&#x2019;s still too early to know the storm&#x2019;s path, we know we have to be prepared,&#x201D; Cooper&#x2019;s office said. &#x201C;During harvest, time is of the essence. Action today can avoid losses due to Florence.&#x201D;
	
	Cooper has since issued Executive Order 52, temporarily waiving the cap on hours of service restrictions for trucks traveling through NC, as well as removing caps on size and weight for those vehicles transporting crops and livestock. This allows for potentially necessary transportation of both livestock, poultry and crops away from danger, as well as equipment, supplies and services to storm-affected areas.
	
	As statistical variability makes landfall timing almost impossible to predict with mathematical precision, meteorologists across the Eastern seaboard are warning that coastal impact might occur as early as Thursday, September 13. As Florence approaches the mainland it will be feeding on warmer waters that can dramatically increase its power, especially if it maintains a slower pace.
	
	State and local emergency officials from the Carolinas to Maryland are asking residentsnear the ocean to begin basic preparations to protect persons and property from high-velocity gales. These include the installation of storm shutters and the trimming of tree limbs weak enough to pose a debris threat.
	
	The Sundial spoke by phone to WRAL&#x2019;s executive weather producer Aimee Wilmoth, who pointed out that in the Triangle wind is a secondary hazard compared to problems incurred from flooding. &#x201C;Something to consider is with the tremendous amount of rain we&#x2019;ve had over the past couple months, the ground is soaked,&#x201D; Wilmoth said.
	
	Wind is still a concern. &#x201C;Trees are already weak at this point, and it&#x2019;s not going to take much wind to knock some of them down.&#x201D; And if those trees happen to be near electrical lines, &#x201C;we could be talking about some major power outages.&#x201D;</body>

    <title>UNC Prepped Faculty for ICE Visits</title>
    <subhead></subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>CHAPEL HILL &#x2014; Administrators at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill have been preparing faculty and staff for possible inquiries from federal law enforcement, including Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), according to emails released to the Raleigh News &amp;amp; Observer in response to multiple Freedom of Information Act filings.
	
	The N&amp;amp;O&#x2019;s investigation, published September 7, was prompted by earlier reporting by NC Policy Watch, which began hearing complaints about ICE visits to campus earlier this summer when they published portions of an email sent to colleagues by Department of Psychiatry chairman David Rubinow. 
	
	Rubinow&#x2019;s concerns were sparked at a briefing he attended named &#x201C;Guidelines for Handling Information Requests from Federal Agents,&#x201D; where he was informed that &#x201C;apparently, visits to University work areas are now occurring.&#x201D; 
	
	In an attempt to quell concerns, the Office of the Executive Vice Chancellor and Provost released a memo to all deans and department heads in May, which spelled out the official policy. When approached by federal or state agents, the memo explained, they should be immediately directed to University Police, who will be best equipped to handle any questions. 
	
	The emailed memo provided links to a website hosting a detailed frequently-asked-questions page to address specific worries. The page encourages &#x201C;students and scholars studying or working in non-immigrant status and DACA and undocumented students and employees seek the advice of an immigration attorney&#x201D; if they feel unprepared to handle a surprise visit by federal officers.  
	
	The Sundial spoke with ICE Southern Regional Communications Director Bryan Cox by phone, who expressed perplexity at the recent uptick in calls from the Chapel Hill area. His organization has a longstanding policy against enforcing immigration laws in what are called &#x201C;sensitive locations.&#x201D; Sites considered off-limits include schools, hospitals, churches and religious ceremonies. 
	
	Cox did note that only the organization&#x2019;s immigration division would be subject to that rule. &#x201C;We also have a criminal investigative division,&#x201D; he explained. &#x201C;We enforce more than 400 federal statutes involving the illegal movement of people and goods.
	
	&#x201C;The [sensitive locations] policy would not preclude agents doing a criminal investigation of something else,&#x201D; such as drug or weapons trafficking, Cox said. However, &#x201C;I&#x2019;ve checked with our folks to see if there has been some specific recent incident at UNC, and there has not.&#x201D;   
	
	The Sundial reached out to UNC&#x2019;s media relations office, but has received no comment as of this publication.</body>

    <title>Edgecombe Town Still Reeling From Double Homicide</title>
    <subhead></subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>LEGGETT &#x2014; A community is still reeling from the double murder in Edgecombe County of the mayor of the small town of Leggett and his wife. 
	
	Law enforcement have not commented on potential motives for the crime, but have asserted that it was an isolated incident. Three people have been arrested in the slaying of the couple in their home this past week.
	
	Leggett, town of less than 100 population, is approximately 13 miles east of Rocky Mount.
	
	The bodies of Gary Skelton and his wife, Jackie Skelton, were discovered at their home on Thursday, September 6 by local law enforcement following up on a recently filed missing persons report. Prior to holding elected office, Gary Skelton was a retired commercial banker with a BB&amp;amp;T branch in Rocky Mount. 
	
	The official Edgecombe Sheriff&#x2019;s Office Facebook page posted a bulletin reading in part: &#x201C;Deputies were called to a residence in Leggett to check the welfare of someone thought to be missing. Deputies discovered two people deceased on the property&#x2026; At this time, no one else is believed to be in danger. Suspects are in custody.&#x201D;
	
	The Sheriff&#x2019;s Office chose to withhold the victims&#x2019; identities from reporters and the public for approximately 24 hours, but confirmed the victims as the deceased couple on Sept. 7. 
	
	The three people were alleged in connection with the crime within eight hours of the discovery of the crime scene. Two of the three people detained are in their mid-twenties and the third is a teenager. Two were charged with murder in the first degree, and one with conspiring to commit robbery with a dangerous weapon.

    <title>Updated Hurricane Florence Developments and Path Projections</title>
    <subhead></subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>NORTH CAROLINA &#x2014; The eye of Hurricane Florence was over Wilmington at 9 AM Friday morning, having lingered south of the Pamlico Sound throughout the night, causing widespread flooding and power outages, and putting lives at risk on the North Carolina coast. 
	
	Florence was moving slowly, tracking along the Carolina coast at a speed of 6 miles per hour from the west, with wind speeds of 90 mph. The storm was projected to linger on the coast and dump heavy rains on North Carolina coastal communities and estuaries with rainfall of up to 40 inches. 
	
	&#x201C;This hurricane 's been beating us up all day long,&#x201D; said the mayor of Morehead City, Jerry Jones, to MSNBC&#x2019;s Brian Williams late on Thursday. &#x201C;And she doesn't look like she wants to go away any time soon.&#x201D;
	
	Many of those who did not evacuate during the week, when Florence approached the coast as a Category 4 hurricane south of Bermuda, have been without power since Thursday night. Officials in storm-hit areas warned residents to stay in their homes as waters coursed through the streets in Wilmington and other inhabited areas.
	
	Maps showing the path of Hurricane Florence had changed between Wednesday and Thursday, changing the projection of Florence sweeping through the Triangle to it swinging south, starting at Wilmington, heading into South Carolina and charting a course that would take it to the southwest of Charlotte. 
	
	&#x201C;Stay home,&#x201D; Chief Buddy Martinette of the Wilmington Fire Department said in a Friday morning television interview. &#x201C;As a matter of fact, you&#x2019;re going to get stranded if you go out. One of our biggest problems we have now is downed trees, so it&#x2019;s a little bit of a jigsaw puzzle trying to get from point A to point B.&#x201D;
	
	Carteret County experienced the brunt of the storm Thursday night, which Jones said included extensive flooding and many downed trees.  Florence caused flooding on land up the Neuse River and around the Pamlico Sound, creating devastation in the town of New Bern. 
	
	Swift water rescue &#x2014; recue from moving water conditions &#x2014; was on the way for New Bern residents trapped by the storm, the town&#x2019;s Twitter feed reported Friday. New Bern&#x2019;s water was reported Friday morning by official sources as safe to drink, contrary to rumor.
	
	New Bern Mayor Pro Tem Sabrina Bengel said that 4,325 residences had been reported damaged by the storm, and the city was on a 24-hour curfew until 7 AM Saturday. 
	
	Emergency workers and volunteers in Wilmington were engaged in rescues during the temporary lull afforded by the eye of the storm, the calm center of the hurricane.
	
	&#x201C;Between the downed power lines, the debris in the street and the trees, people need to stay put,&#x201D; said Martinette.
	
	Martinette said that Wilmington fire crews &#x201C;are taking advantage of this brief lull, we are trying to go out in the community and access some of these people that we haven&#x2019;t been able to get to.&#x201D;
	
	Closer to the Triangle, wind speeds at RDU International Airport were being measured at 38 mph Friday morning. Overcast skies, sporadic rainfall and buffeting winds characterized the weather Friday morning in Carrboro. 
	
	Patients at UNC Memorial Hospital and other inland medical facilities were being discharged whenever possible Thursday to make room for patients from evacuated hospitals on the coast.
	
	Florence was downgraded from a Category 4 to a Category 1 by late Thursday, a rating based on lowered wind speeds. Weather experts warn that slower winds mean the hurricane dumps more rain over the regions where it lingers. 
	
	The eye of Hurricane Florence made landfall at Wrightsville beach at 7:15 AM Friday, the National Weather Service reported in a joint press conference with FEMA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). 
	
	There was a tornado watch in effect Friday morning in more than a dozen North Carolina counties southeast of (and including) Wake County, that would continue through Friday night, FEMA officials said. Storm surge watch would be in effect through Sunday. Storm surge would be at high-tide cycles, NOAA officials warned. </body>

    <title>Florence Rains and Floods Extend Danger Conditions</title>
    <subhead></subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>NORTH CAROLINA&amp;nbsp;&#x2014; Hurricane Florence &#x201C;has never been more dangerous than it is right now,&#x201D; said North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper in a Sunday afternoon press conference addressing the ongoing damage the storm will cause as rains and flooding continue into Monday.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	
	Despite being downgraded to a tropical depression, the hurricane&#x2019;s dissipated rainclouds sustained heavy rainfall across southeastern North Carolina and caused flood warnings along creeks and rivers from Guilford County to the coast Sunday night.  
	
	 Fayetteville and surrounding areas along the Cape Fear River and Little River were under mandatory flood evacuation, with river stages expected to rise and crest. A &lt;a id="Temp" href="http://www.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=e015ae76a8e54c54ab3da77c4e1a4e0c&amp;amp;extent=-8843481.4494%2C4131865.5339%2C-8690607.3928%2C4214264.6503%2C102100]" target="_blank"&gt;map &lt;/a&gt;provided by ARCGIS showed mandatory evacuation areas up the Little River to Moore County, and from the Little&#x2019;s confluence with the Cape Fear River down through Fayetteville to the Cumberland-Bladen county line.
	
	The Cape Fear River at Fayetteville was running 10 feet above flood stage, at 44.5 feet Sunday, and expected to crest at 62 feet Tuesday. The Little River, one of its headwaters, was running at 28.5 feet at Manchester near several U.S. military installations, 10 feet above flood stage, expected to crest at 34.4 feet Monday.
	
	Mandatory evacuation areas along the Little River covered Pope Air Force Base and Fort Bragg, though it was not clear whether staffing and equipment were at regular levels Sunday night. Service members stationed there were under orders to stay sheltered unless required to report for duty, the military news outlet &#x201C;Stars and Stripes&#x201D; reported. 
	
	As of publication, at least 16 deaths were reported  as a result of the storm, including two people who were determined to have been killed by carbon monoxide poisoning in Horry County, S.C., and one in a traffic accident in Kershaw County, S.C. 
	
	CBS News reported at 3 PM Sunday that 740,000 homes and businesses are still without power. 
	
	Rescue efforts across the region continue non-stop, as some residents who ignored mandatory evacuation orders have found themselves in perilous situations. 
	
	Woody White, the chairman of the board of commissioners of New Hanover County, spoke to reporters at a news conference early Sunday saying that Wilmington has been cut off by floodwaters at all major points of entry.  This news followed reports that the Cape Fear Public Utility Authority had no fuel left on hand and might have to discontinue water service to customers; however, the utility released a statement only hours later indicating that a new fuel source had been located and that its linemen &#x201C;are working to supply our equipment and generators quickly." 
	
	Reports from both residents and journalists across the state indicate that emergency-level conditions have overwhelmed local first responders, requiring assistance from the Coast Guard as well as volunteer rescue groups like the Cajun Navy. Coast Guard Admiral Karl Schultz told ABC 11 reporters that his biggest concern as of 2 PM Sunday was &#x201C;the rising water.&#x201D; 
	
	&#x201C;The storm is moving very slow... It's going to be in the state another, you know, good part of 24 hours before it moves out up through the Ohio Valley,&#x201D; Schultz added.
	
	Cell phone footage posted to the Cajun Navy 2016 Facebook Page appeared Sunday afternoon to show the breach of a major levee in Lumberton, located in Robeson County, which could expose the city to drastic flood levels.
	
	All Sunday, officials urged residents not to return to flooded evacuated areas, as Florence dumped rain to near historic levels from the coast inland to the Piedmont. Swift water rescue efforts had saved people stranded in New Bern and other communities; swift water rescue crews from as far away as Berkley and Sacramento, Calif., performed rescues in Sampson county on Sunday.
	
	For those travelling by car or truck to escape affected areas, officials have advised the public to avoid I-95 as much as may be possible, and that Interstate 95 was closed from Exit 65 to Exit 138. I-40 has reportedly been completely closed between Wilmington and I-95. 
	
	North Carolina Department of Transportation spokesman Andrew Barksdale posted on the @NCEmergency Twitter page, &#x201C;currently, 171 primary roads are closed. The situation continues to worsen.&#x201D; 
	
	A news release Sunday said that at 4:30 PM, there were nearly 700 road closures across the state.
	
	&#x201C;Drivers Should Stay In Place Unless Evacuating,&#x201D; was the headline of a North Carolina Department of Transportation news statement Sunday. 
	
	President Trump approved a &#x201C;major disaster declaration&#x201D; on Saturday, September 15, which will allow for increased federal funding for eight counties in North Carolina: Beaufort, Brunswick, Carteret, Craven, New Hanover, Onslow, Pamlico and Pender counties. 
	
	According a FEMA statement, that assistance could include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses and other programs to help people and businesses recover from the disaster. 
	
	Barksdale also told the Fayetteville Observer that &#x201C;Cumberland, Robeson, Columbus, Bladen and Hoke counties are especially hard-hit with road closures.&#x201D; 
	
	The National Hurricane Center is warning that tornadoes are still a distinct possibility in most of North Carolina and northern South Carolina for the next 24 hours. </body>

    <body>&lt;div&gt;CHAPEL HILL &#x2014; Heavy overnight rains from the remnants of Hurricane Florence produced flood conditions in Chapel Hill and Carrboro the morning of Monday, September 17, resulting in school cancellations, the halting of some public services and multiple road closings.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;While the Triangle did not suffer the worst effects of the storm (none of the 17 statewide  deaths reported thus far occurred in Orange, Durham or Wake counties), emergency responders have had their hands full tending to stalled vehicles and conducting well-being checks for concerned families and friends.&lt;p&gt;
	
	After receiving a phone message between 6 and 7 AM indicating that classes would be delayed by two hours, the faculty and staff of Carrboro-Chapel Hill City Schools were eventually told to stay home once it had been determined that students and bus drivers would be unable to access key roadways. 
	
	Orange County schools, however, proceeded with their regular Monday schedule, prompting some concern on social media. Durham Public Schools also remained open Monday, a decision for which the Durham schools department apologized.
	
	"Although we made the best decision we could with the information we had this morning, we are sorry to our families and staff for the difficulties that came from our decision to open school," said a letter Durham Public Schools sent to parents and staff Monday.
	
	As of this publication, approximately 4,200 customers throughout Orange County have been affected by 22 power outages starting at around 6:30 AM Monday, according to Duke Energy. Approximately 1,500 of those resulted from the collapse of a 200-year-old tree early this morning on Calvin Street in Hillsborough. Meanwhile, close to half a million homes and business remain without power across the state.
	
	Chapel Hill Transit suspended all bus routes until 1:30 PM Monday, at which point limited service of the following routes were resumed: CCX, CPX, FCX, HU, J, JFX, NS, NU, S and 420. However, all routes will be suspended again at 8 PM Monday evening.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;
	
	Occupants of two buildings at Estes Park Apartments, located on Estes Drive Extension in Carrboro, were told to evacuate due to unsafe water levels. Carrboro Fire Rescue used a transit bus for two of the residents, with the rest choosing to relocate with their own vehicles.
	
	The photographs of the completely flooded bridge crossing University Lake on Jones Ferry Road, in Carrboro between Old Fayetteville Road and Old Greensboro Road hit Twitter at 9 AM, while pictures of severe flooding of South Estes Drive near University Place were &lt;a id="Temp" href="https://twitter.com/WCHLChapelboro/status/1041667350779584518?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1041667350779584518&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fchapelboro.com%2Fnews%2Fweather%2Frain-from-hurricane-florence-causes-flooding-road-closures" target="_blank"&gt;posted &lt;/a&gt;around the same time. 
	
	At noon photos of Chapel Country Club&#x2019;s golf course under at least a foot of water were uploaded across multiple accounts on Facebook. 
	
	Shops at Eastgate Crossing were half-submerged after flash flooding at Booker Creek on Monday morning. Access to Fordham Boulevard was restricted for several hours and the swollen creek threatened to run across Franklin Street near 15-501, but receded by the afternoon.&amp;nbsp;
	
	Piedmont rivers and creeks are flooding, and most are expected to crest before Tuesday morning. As of 6 PM Monday, September 17, the National Weather Service recorded Haw River near Bynum at 17.18 feet (6 feet over flood level), Deep River near Moncure at 15.21 feet (6 feet over flood level), Cape Fear River at Fayetteville at 54.76 feet (20 feet over flood level), Neuse River at Smithfield at 18.91 feet (4 feet over flood level) and Rocky River near Norwood at 36.41 feet (16 feet over flood level). Little River in Manchester set a record at 35.32 feet, almost double its flood level of 18 feet. &lt;br&gt;</body>

    <title>Flooding Eases, But Florence's Bruises Will Linger</title>
    <subhead></subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>CHAPEL HILL &#x2014; While the rains may be over, Hurricane Florence&#x2019;s impact will linger for weeks and months, and immediate damage was still impacting coastal areas and communities up-country Tuesday as North Carolina river towns experienced sometimes-historic flood cresting and coastal areas continued to drain. 
	
	By Wednesday, at least 32 deaths were attributed to Florence, which hit the North Carolina coast as a Category 1 hurricane Thursday and lingered, drifting south over Myrtle Beach and breaking apart as it slouched inland through early Monday morning, dumping rain at levels rarely seen during previous hurricane events in the Carolinas. 
	
	To the estimated tune of more than 15 billion dollars, Florence will hurt the pocketbooks of residents, businesses, federal aid and insurers for months and &#x2014;&amp;nbsp;if past is prologue &#x2014;&amp;nbsp;years more. Estimates from Moody&#x2019;s Analytics suggested that damage Friday, before flooding reached critical levels inland, hovered between $10 and $15 billion, placing Florence among the top 10 most expensive storm events, as reported by CNBC. 
	
	The impact of closures has not stopped members of the Orange County business community from lending a hand to those whose lives have been dislodged more profoundly by Florence. 
	
	Students and officials from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill began taking donations of nonperishable food products and additional supplies on Tuesday, September 18 at the Williamson Center parking lot at 450 Skipper Bowles Drive in Chapel Hill. They will be accepting donations through Thursday, September 20 from 7:30 AM until 6 PM and on Friday, September 21 from 7:30 AM until 12 PM.
	
	In a statement released to media and posted on the UNC website, Chancellor Carol Folt thanked everyone on campus who had been involved in emergency preparation and said the University was &#x201C;very appreciative of those who transformed the Friday Center to serve as a shelter for 500 North Carolinians in less than 24 hours.&#x201D;
	
	&#x201C;As we know from past experience, the road to recovery is a long one that will take all of us working together to persevere,&#x201D; Folt added.
	
	Mandey Brown, owner of the Chapel Hill bar and restaurant Imbibe, located at 108 Henderson Street, began accepting supplies and canned foodstuffs on Saturday, September 15. Brown is also the proprietor of Zog&#x2019;s, a popular college bar one floor above Imbibe, and is able to receive donations late into the evening at that location, which closes at 2 AM. She told the Sundial the plan is to continue &#x201C;until we have nowhere to send them.&#x201D; She has been operating both businesses as usual, albeit with a little less space.
	
	The immediate destination for most the donations Brown has received so far is the Durham Fruit Warehouse at 305 South Dillard Street, an official donation branch for a &#x201C;frontline resource mobilization&#x201D; effort named A Just Florence Recovery, which will be accepting food and supplies only until 6 PM on Thursday, September 18. 
	
	&#x201C;I&#x2019;m also sending stuff to [Raleigh-Durham International Airport],&#x201D; Brown said, &#x201C;where we have a bunch of pilots who have been doing routine air drops over affected areas.&#x201D; She partnered with RDU after a pilot friend found colleagues willing to help.
	
	&#x201C;There&#x2019;s been a steady stream of U-Hauls picking things up every hour,&#x201D; said Brown. 
	
	Fitch Lumber &amp;amp; Hardware, at 309 North Greensboro Street in Carrboro, was also still accepting donations on the afternoon of Tuesday, September 18; their Facebook page posted a list of items that hard-hit areas are in urgent need of, like bug spray, diapers, hand sanitizer and gloves. 
	
	Emergency workers assisted Orange County employees in opening a shelter for anyone nearby who may be temporarily displaced by the flooding, at the OC Social Services Building at 113 Mayo Street in Hillsborough. 
	
	The bridge crossing University Lake on Old Greensboro Road is still closed as of this publication, and will remain so until the North Carolina Department of Transportation has the chance to conduct a safety inspection.</body>

    <title>District Catches Heat Over Yom Kippur School Days</title>
    <subhead></subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>CHAPEL HILL &#x2014; A group of religious leaders has publicly expressed dissatisfaction with a decision of the Chapel Hill&#x2013;Carrboro City School Board to hold classes on the Jewish holy day Yom Kippur, which fell on Wednesday, September 19. 
	
	In a lengthy open letter, the protesting group wrote, &#x201C;Several years ago, after much work and many conversations, the board committed to the principle that children (and teachers and staff) should not have to choose between observing their religion and attending school.&#x201D;
	
	 The letter continued, -&#x201C;An unintended consequence of this make-up day is that, once again, Jewish students, teachers and staff and their families must choose.&#x201D;
	
	Among the signatories of the letter were Rabbi Jen Feldman of Kehillah Synagogue and Reverend Dr. Marcus McFaul of Olin T. Binkley Memorial Baptist Church, both in Chapel Hill; Rabbi John Franken of the Judea Reform Congregation in Durham; and Reverend Margaret LaMotte Torrence of University Presbyterian Church, also in Chapel Hill.
	
	The same date was scheduled as a teacher workday on the 2018 school year calendar. Despite Yom Kippur&#x2019;s inclusion on the list of legal holidays named in North Carolina General Statute 103-4, it is not a date on which state public sector employees are guaranteed time off, nor are they required to receive holiday pay. 
	
	All teachers were emailed a letter over the weekend from the central office informing them that students who missed school Wednesday would have the absence excused, and for faculty &#x2014; but not all staff &#x2014; it was considered an &#x201C;optional workday.&#x201D; 
	
	&#x201C;Jewish staff could also take the day off by using personal or annual leave, depending on the job classification,&#x201D; said Georgge Stackpole, an ESL teacher at Culbreth Middle School who received the department&#x2019;s communication.
	
	Rani Dasi, the CHCCS Board Chair, issued a statement in response to the criticism on the evening of September 18. &#x201C;Losing additional days so early in the year, significantly impacts education and other issues we see (e.g. food insecurity) when students are not in school,&#x201D; she wrote.
	
	&#x201C;We are anticipating increasing frequency and intensity of weather events, and because of constraints on school calendars, this could create further scheduling challenges.&#x201D;
	
	In an interview with the Sundial, Dasi said, &#x201C;Our students have lost three days of instruction already, and we can&#x2019;t afford to lose another day.&#x201D;
	
	She continued, &#x201C;I wouldn&#x2019;t say [scheduling class on Yom Kippur] was a mistake, but I would say we will definitely try harder to avoid situations like this.&#x201D;
	
	Dasi also acknowledged that Friday, September 21 is Ashura, a Muslim holiday, and school is scheduled normally. &#x201C;We want to make sure we are considering all the members of our community,&#x201D; she said.
	
	In a brief phone conversation with The Sundial, CHCCS public relations director Jeff Nash said that although a federal law necessitates school closure on Christmas and Christmas Eve, &#x201C;I used to be on the Board&#x2019;s calendar committee...and I don&#x2019;t think any of the [other] religious holidays are on&#x201D; the list of official school year holidays.

    <title>NCDOT: 'If You Evacuated: Please Do Not Return'</title>
    <subhead></subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>NORTH CAROLINA &#x2014; Hurricane Florence's death count was increased to 41 as of Thursday, September 20, according to the Associated Press. The storm is now responsible for 31 deaths in North Carolina, with eight dead in South Carolina and two in Virginia.
	
	North Carolina Department of Public Safety spokesman Keith Acree told media outlets that since his update on Tuesday, September 18, four newly- reported deaths took place in Duplin County, near Jacksonville. Acree was unable to elaborate on the details of the four deaths.
	
	According to the North Carolina Department of Transportation, extended portions of both I-95 and I-40 remain blocked by flood conditions as of Thursday afternoon. I-40 is still the site of some severe flooding, and much of the hundred-mile stretch between Wilmington and I-95 remains closed. 
	
	North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper, who spoke at a press briefing early Thursday evening, told reporters that "recovery is beginning in many places, but for some communities, today is still a matter of life and death." 
	
	Governor Cooper warned that flooding still poses a clear and present danger, possibly worsening in a few locations. He explained that 16 rivers across the state were at &#x201C;major flood stage.&#x201D;
	
	Officials with North Carolina&#x2019;s southernmost county, Brunswick, took to Twitter at 6:49 AM Thursday morning with the following message: &#x201C;IF YOU EVACUATED: PLEASE DO NOT RETURN. Many roads remain impassable. Many are washed out or structurally compromised. There are limited supplies of gas, food and water in many areas and responders are focused on getting supplies to those who are in these areas.&#x201D; 
	
	A 6 AM message from the NCDOT Twitter handle informed travelers that &#x201C;about 750 roads remain closed.&#x201D; That number is down from 2,200 at its peak. 
	
	Transportation authorities have also warned drivers not to rely on smartphone navigation apps; the flooding situation is dynamic and programs could lead vehicles to submerged or closed roads.</body>

    <title>Law Stifling NC Farmers Unions is Blocked in Court</title>
    <subhead></subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>GREENSBORO &#x2014;  Labor unions, which have fewer privileges in North Carolina than in many other states, were handed a victory here Thursday by a federal district court judge in Greensboro.
	
	U.S. District Court Judge Loretta Biggs temporarily blocked a state law that prohibits farm owners from entering into union-negotiated contracts as a way of settling labor disputes, kicking the issue up to a higher court. 
	
	Biggs made the ruling over a lawsuit brought by the Farm Labor Organizing Committee (FLOC) and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU),
	
	As written, the Farm Act (NC Senate Bill 615), which passed through the North Carolina General Assembly in late June of 2017, would also prohibit farm workers from directly transferring a percentage of their paychecks toward union dues. 
	
	The FLOC is the only farm workers&#x2019; union currently operating in North Carolina. 
	
	North Carolina has long been categorized a &#x201C;right-to-work&#x201D; state, a misnomer for laws that limit the rights and privileges of labor organizers. While labor unions remain legal in some sectors of the state&#x2019;s employment force, in North Carolina union membership cannot be considered a hiring requirement. As a result, union organizations lose the efficacy because the traditional union tactics that rely on a culture of solidarity, such as work-stoppages or picketing, are less effective as tools of collective bargaining. 
	
	The United States Congress passed the Taft-Hartley Act in 1947, which overturned huge portions of New Deal&#x2013;era labor reforms. Individual states were consequently given the opportunity to opt out of union-friendly policies, and North Carolina adopted its right-to-work statutes the same year.
	
	If the Farm Act is upheld, a farm owner settling a dispute &#x2014; such as worker mistreatment &#x2014; would not be able to settle it with a union-negotiated contract; workers would likely have to sue for dispute resolution independently of a union.
	
	In the original complaint filed with the court in late August, the plaintiffs charged the Farm Act was both racist and unconstitutional, as it revokes the &#x201C;contractual rights and privileges from a workforce that is overwhelmingly comprised of Latino noncitizens and a union with a membership comprised largely of workers from Mexico working under the...agricultural visa program (&#x2018;guest workers&#x2019;).&#x201D; 
	
	&#x201C;North Carolina&#x2019;s law is clearly designed to make it harder, if not impossible, for the state&#x2019;s only farmworkers union to advocate for sorely needed protections against exploitation and bad working conditions,&#x201D; ACLU staff attorney Brian Hauss wrote in a statement released to the press on Thursday. </body>

    <title>UNC Houses Displaced Florence Survivors</title>
    <subhead></subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>CHAPEL HILL &#x2014; The struggle for a return to normalcy and stability after Hurricane Florence is still being waged by thousands of survivors across North Carolina, many of whom were forced to abandon their homes and belongings and to endure separation from their communities and loved ones. 
	
	Some storm survivors continue to face an uncertain timetable for return to their homes and communities. 
	
	In Chapel Hill, the large convention center managed by the University of North Carolina will remain open as shelter for those displaced by Hurricane Florence for as long as those displaced there must remain. 
	
	Cheryl Jaram, who lost her home to flooding in Jacksonville, is among 150 displaced persons who still remained at the Friday Center a week after the storm hit.
	
	&#x201C;The whole road I lived on is totally washed away,&#x201D; Jaram said. She is still figuring out what the next move is.
	
	Jaram, who uses a wheelchair, is now in an unfamiliar part of the state with no friends or family to lean on except a tiny lapdog named Angel, who leaves her side only when being tended to by veterinary staff. 
	
	But despite her current state of affairs, Jaram stays lighthearted. &#x201C;I&#x2019;ve gone through a lot in life, but have always had a positive attitude,&#x201D; she said with a smile.
	
	The Red Cross, in partnership with University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, re-vamped the convention center, whose full name is the William and Ida Friday Center for Continuing Education.
	
	The Friday Center, off Raleigh Road and east of Finley Golf Club, is used year-round for conferences and conventions. Normal activity there is suspended in the wake of one of the worst hurricane disasters to hit North Carolina.
	
	Bonnie Knight ended up at the shelter after being forced to leave the Wake Forest area, where she and her husband had been camping. &#x201C;I called around to see if any emergency shelters were opened, and the only one I got any response from was Orange County,&#x201D; she told the Sundial. 
	
	She and her husband are technically homeless, but they do own a vehicle and were able to make it to safety in time with help from attentive Orange County Social Service Office staffers. &#x201C;They called me back four times that day to make sure I got to the shelter and knew exactly where it was at.&#x201D;
	
	Knight spoke in a maternal tone of her fellow hurricane survivors, and indicated that the facility wasn&#x2019;t problem-free. &#x201C;The shelter itself has been fine, and the Red Cross has been fine, but there have been a few incidents. A handful of the workers have been causing problems,&#x201D; she said, hesitant to elaborate. &#x201C;But I addressed it.&#x201D;
	
	&#x201C;I observe everything,&#x201D; she added. &#x201C;If I see something wrong, and I can&#x2019;t fix it, I go straight to the next person up [in power], so I can help.&#x201D;
	
	Most of the storm shelters in Orange County were established to offer respite from the strong winds, rain and flooding that accompanied Florence&#x2019;s historic rainfall. School cafeterias and gymnasiums, among other public buildings, took in locals who felt unsafe riding out the worst of the extreme weather at home. 
	
	The estimated total of survivors who spent at least one night in a shelter as a result of the storm is 102,000 across Virginia and both Carolinas. 
	
	Mark Newell, an 18-year employee of the Red Cross who has been working onsite at the Friday Center since it opened as a shelter, explained, &#x201C;We&#x2019;ve got volunteers and team members working here, and a lot of them have had to fly in to fill the need, because I believe at one time there were 140 shelters operating in the state.&#x201D;
	
	At its height, the survivor population living at the Friday Center was about 480 people. Remaining are 150 guests. Only a handful of the storm castaways are from Orange County; Newell expects to others return &#x201C;as counties are deemed safe enough for travel.&#x201D; 
	
	According to the Red Cross&#x2019;s numbers, on the night of September 21, a little over a week after Florence hit the coast, there remained active 34 shelters across North Carolina, still housing 2,800 people. 
	
	Over the long term, shelters cannot provide adequate sanitary housing for individuals and families unable to return due to their severely damaged and unlivable properties.
	
	Apart from being sensitive to the stress level of a large group of dislocated strangers, the primary obstacle to resident comfort is health care and hygiene maintenance. So, in addition to the Red Cross physicians, doctors on the faculty at UNC medical school donated time to attend to various ailments. 
	
	&#x201C;We worked with the state to get in two shower trailers, a washer and dryer trailer, and a pet trailer,&#x201D; Newell said. &#x201C;UNC has been super supportive&#x2026;and while we&#x2019;re using their convention center, any vendors that were set up to come in have been cancelled.&#x201D; 
	
	On Friday evening, the UNC marching band played a short concert in the middle of the Friday Center, accompanied by the UNC cheerleading squad showing off impressive gymnastics to a group of transfixed children and amused campus police officers. 
	
	When the performance ended, a quiet washed over the building and some shelter residents retired to the conference-turned-dorm rooms lined with cots. 
	
	If you or someone you know would like to volunteer at the Friday Center, call the switchboard operator at Red Cross headquarters at 1(800) 733-2767, who can put you in contact with shelter staff.</body>

    <title>&#x2018;Goodbye, House.&#x2019; Florence's Latest Victim Departs Camelot Village Apartment</title>
    <subhead></subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>CHAPEL HILL &#x2014; Hurricane Florence isn&#x2019;t quite done with Chapel Hill. One of the storm&#x2019;s last evacuees left his flood-damaged home at Camelot Village Apartments on Wednesday, September 26, almost two weeks after the storm dragged destruction inland across North Carolina.
	
	Barry Fearrington left his apartment in a motorized wheelchair on his way to a hotel room, uncertain when he would see his apartment in Building G again. 
	
	&#x201C;Goodbye, house,&#x201D; he said as his chair left the ramp to his front door and rolled up the walkway behind his building Wednesday. 
	
	He navigated his chair around boxes of his dry possessions and past heaps of debris and drywall extracted from the flooded apartments on the first floor. In the apartment courts, in front of every building, were piled the former possessions and former walls of Florence&#x2019;s last victims. 
	
	The businesses and homes in the community surrounding the University Place mall were some of the worst impacted in Chapel Hill by Florence&#x2019;s floodwaters, and the low-income housing units near Bolin Creek have borne the brunt. The management office at Camelot Village said 57 of its 70 apartments and condos were damaged as a consequence of the storm. 
	
	Judy Tripp, who works for rental office full time, told the Sundial that a substantial number of units saw flood levels reach above electrical outlets, &#x201C;and that means a much longer restoration time... We&#x2019;ve been told two to three months.&#x201D;
	
	Camelot Village office administrators manage about half of the units as rentals, with rest being individually owned condominiums. Camelot Village is one of the few apartment complexes in Chapel Hill which accepts the federal housing voucher better known as Section 8.
	
	Residents were told to evacuate prior to Florence&#x2019;s landfall on Thursday, September 13. Some were taken to the emergency shelter quickly established at Smith Middle School on Seawell Road, and access to their homes was restricted through Friday, September 14.
	
	On Saturday, September 15, an email went out to residents from A2Z Realty, the property management company that oversees Camelot Village, saying that people would be let back into their condos if they made a request to return.
	
	On the evening of Sunday, September 16, Orange County experienced severe rainfall as the remnants of Florence moved inland over the southern coastal plains region and across the Piedmont.
	
	Rivers systems from the mountains to the coast crested at flood levels. Bolin Creek was one of two flooded Chapel Hill creeks that caused damage to settled areas on the morning of September 17. 
	
	At 8:14 AM on September 17, a brief email went out to residents from A2Z&#x2019;s office: &#x201C;Camelot is flooding. Please be safe and leave ASAP.&#x201D;
	
	Most of Camelot Village&#x2019;s residents were displaced to area shelters or with friends and relatives. It was the second time many of them had evacuated for Florence, and for most of those who were displaced by Monday&#x2019;s flooding, their evacuation will be extended for weeks or months.
	
	Many of those with no place to go were sent to the University of North Carolina&#x2019;s Friday Center, where members of the Red Cross and other volunteers were taking in storm refugees. 
	
	But as more and more people were fleeing the coast and Cape Fear region, room at the Friday Center needed to be freed up, so locals were relocated to a shelter in Hillsborough run by Orange County Social Services. That shelter, which was smaller and not involved with the Red Cross, is now closed.
	
	Fearrington, who sought unsuccessfully to be admitted to UNC Hospital, returned and slept for several nights in his flooded home, where waters had risen several inches and left a musty and feverish smell.
	
	When he left his home Wednesday, he had no plan for residence beyond that evening, when friends had secured a hotel room for him.
	
	Flooding in Camelot Village was not necessarily unanticipated. Many of their apartments flooded in June 2013 when Bolin Creek rose during a period of heavy rains. 
	
	Camelot Village was not the only community in Chapel Hill where flooding posed huge problems, and far from the only low-income neighborhood where residents faced emergency from rising waters. 
	
	Lindsey Shewmaker, a representative of Orange County Human Services, told the Daily Tar Heel that Red Cross analysts have yet to determine much money the destruction will ultimately cost Chapel Hill and surrounding towns; and that number will likely not be determined for months.
	
	&#x201C;North Carolina is unique in the sense that they have a lot of experience, whether it&#x2019;s Hurricane Fran, Bertha, Irene or Matthew, the list goes on and on,&#x201D; said Gavin Smith, the Director of the Department of Homeland Security Coastal Resilience Center of Excellence.
	
	Smith, also a UNC faculty member, told the Sundial, &#x201C;I would dare say that when it comes to the response that the experience really helped them.&#x201D;
	
	&#x201C;One of the things that happened with this event is the federal government declared a disaster, which allowed more assets to enter into the state before the storm even made landfall,&#x201D; Smith said. &#x201C;That&#x2019;s not unheard of, but it&#x2019;s certainly not common.&#x201D;
	
	Brookwood Condominiums on Estes Drive, Booker Creek Townhouse Apartments on Booker Creek Road as well as the public housing community Airport Gardens on Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard were all given mandatory evacuation orders the morning of Monday, September 17.
	
	&#x201C;There is a long history of low-income housing in flood hazard areas in North Carolina, there&#x2019;s no doubt about that,&#x201D; Smith said. &#x201C;But after Hurricane Fran and Floyd the state engaged in a large-scale buyout of flood-prone housing. . . so the good news is that a lot of highly vulnerable housing stock was acquired and that land was turned into open space.&#x201D;
	
	But that buyout, said Smith, also reduced the availability of affordable housing for low-income North Carolinians. &#x201C;So we&#x2019;re fixing a problem on one hand, but on the other hand exacerbating a different problem.&#x201D; 
	
	The same day that Bolin Creek flooded Camelot Village, nearby Booker Creek flooded the Eastgate Crossing plaza and stores a little less than a mile away, as it has in years past. Planners and stormwater experts have suggested at Carrboro and Chapel Hill town meetings that the addition by in-town development of impervious surface &#x2014; such as roofs and parking lots &#x2014; has increased the volume and displacement of stormwater runoff. 
	
	Bill Rohe is a distinguished professor of city and regional planning at UNC Chapel Hill, said that new strategies and requirements could manage excessive stormwater runoff in Chapel Hill. 
	
	&#x201C;There are various water management strategies that might be expanded,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;For example, the requirement that runoff be retained on pieces of property for a longer period.&#x201D; 
	
	Rohe said he believes more on-site containment would allow rainwater to drain more slowly, through the ground rather than in streams.  
	
	&#x201C;The more we can hold water where it falls," he said, "the better everyone is going to be."
	
	&lt;br&gt;
	
	&lt;i&gt;Correction: An earlier version of this article gave an incorrect date for the flooding of Camelot Village, and an email sent by A2Z Realty to residents that same day, notifying them of the flooding. These events, the flooding and the notification to residents, occurred on September 17. These errors were made by the publisher, who contributed information to this article.&lt;/i&gt;</body>

    <title>Premier Music Festivals in Carrboro and Durham This Weekend</title>
    <subhead>Art of Cool Festival, September 28&#x2013;29;&#xD;
Carrboro Music Festival, September 29-30</subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>In the Triangle this weekend, Durham and Carrboro each have their own homegrown music festivals: the Art of Cool festival and Carrboro Music Festival respectively.
	
	&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Stars stud Durham's fifth Art of Cool festival&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
	
	DURHAM&amp;nbsp;&#x2014; Hip hop heads, jazzbos, avant-garde electronic noise mongers, soul futurists and other admirers of dope beats should make their way to Durham this weekend for the this year&#x2019;s Art Of Cool festival, for its star-studded lineup. 
	
	All shows will take place in six key venues through downtown: The Pinhook, Bey&#xF9; Caff&#xE8;, Motorco Music Hall, the Durham Armory, Carolina Theater and the Durham Bulls Athletic Park (DBAP). 
	
	The roster grows more impressive every year, and this being its fifth has a lot to brag about. Old-school fans of Salt-N-Pepa will be pleased by the presence of DJ Spinderella, true rap royalty (Durham Armory, 11 PM September 28). The rap and R&amp;amp;B wunderkinds of Young Bull are sure to please any younger alternative hip hop purists, and they may just be one of the most exciting and talented acts to come out the Triangle in years (Pinhook, 10 PM September 28). Not to mention neo-soul pioneers Meshell Ndegeocello (Carolina Theatre, 8:30 PM September 28) and Erykah Badu (Durham Bulls Athletic Park, 10:30 PM September 29), the platinum-selling singer-songwriter Anthony Hamilton (DBAP, 9 PM September 28), and sublime violinist Damien Escobar (DBAP, 7:30 PM September 28) .  
	
	Haitian-American singer-songwriter Maxwell will headline Friday&#x2019;s lineup at 10:30 PM in DBAP. Nas will headline Saturday&#x2019;s lineup at 9 PM also at DBAP, and is sure to perform tracks from his latest album, &#x201C;God's Son the Brave Prince of Life: My Journey, Pt. 1&#x201D;.
	
	AOC prides itself on being &#x201C;Durham born and bred,&#x201D; and it will educational activities in addition to the music, sponsored by an organization called Innovate Your Cool.
	
	According to their official website, for attendees with a general admission one-day pass, &#x201C;early arrival for each performance is advisable to secure admission,&#x201D; as there is limited capacity at each venue, especially the smaller ones.
	
	A full schedule with times and a map of venue locations is available at &lt;a href="http://aocfestival.com/schedule/" target="_blank"&gt;aocfestival.com.&lt;/a&gt; Out-of-towners will also find a list of hotels offering reduced rates for attendees and parking suggestions. &lt;br&gt;
	
	&lt;br&gt;
	
	 
	
	&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;On the street and in clubs, Carrboro Music Festival turns 21&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
	
	CARRBORO &#x2014; The 21st annual Carrboro Music Festival will host nearly two hundred bands and musicians throughout the downtown this weekend. The first performance will begin at 2 PM on Saturday, September 29 at the Town Commons, immediately after the weekly Carrboro Farmers&#x2019; Market, and performances after that will last until Sunday evening.  
	
	Much of the festival&#x2019;s charm comes from its diverse lineup of both local and touring acts, representing a multi-genre extravaganza that includes classical, folk, punk, psychedelic jam bands and electronica, among many others.
	
	Almost no venue will go unused for one of the most anticipated and well-attended events of the year, from the ArtsCenter in the east to Johnny&#x2019;s Gone Fishing in the north.
	
	CMF began in the summer of 1998 as the F&#xEA;te de la Musique, inspired by the free music festival of the same name in France, and playing off the town&#x2019;s unofficial sobriquet &#x201C;The Paris of the Piedmont.&#x201D; The original concept had the yearly date set for the Summer Solstice, but in 2002 when its name officially changed to CMF, it also changed dates to avoid the hazards of holding an outdoor event in hot weather.
	
	 The hard work of organizing is done by the Carrboro Recreation and Parks Department in partnership with the CMF Planning Committee and the Carrboro Tourism Development Authority.
	
	Highlights from this year&#x2019;s roster include Ladies of the Lake, an all-female quintet specializing in traditional Celtic folk music, which has ancient Gaelic, Scottish and Breton influences (Looking Glass Caf&#xE9;, Sunday at 1 PM); The Loose Lucies, a Grateful Dead&#x2013;inspired folk-rock outfit (Johnny&#x2019;s Gone Fishing, Sunday at 1 PM); Ancestor Piratas, the solo art-punk project of Peruvian musician Renzo Ortega (Auto Logic, Sunday at 3 PM); and The Magnolia Klezmer Band, an up-tempo Yiddish-English language 10-piece group (Carrboro Century Center, Sunday at 1 PM). 
	
	A full schedule with times, along with a map of the venues, can be found at the Carrboro Music Festival &lt;a href="carrboromusicfestival.com/311/Carrboro-Music-Festival" target="_blank"&gt;website.&lt;/a&gt;</body>

    <title>Carrboro Music Festival Still Strong in 21st Year</title>
    <subhead></subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>CARRBORO &#x2014; The Carrboro Music Festival has come and gone for the 21st time. This year&#x2019;s tunes, food, antics and weather shone, starting Saturday afternoon with five acts and resuming Sunday at noon for the rest of the almost 200 performers.
	
	This time around, CMF fell on the same weekend as other popular festivals, but luckily most of its attractions took place on Sunday, the day after the others ended. Art Of Cool, a star-studded R&amp;amp;B, jazz and rap festival, was just a 20-minute ride over in Durham; the powerhouse roots- and folk-focused Wide Open Bluegrass festival was booked the same weekend in Raleigh; and up at Blackwood Farm Park in Hillsborough, the first ever Orange County Local Fest showcased the best area food trucks, microbreweries and craft businesses that weren&#x2019;t busy at the other Triangle happenings. 
	
	Carrboro Music Fest stood out with its volume of performers &#x2014; almost 200 &#x2014; and by being free, reflected in its overflowing pedestrian traffic. Weaver Street was blocked off from car traffic, giving a good chunk of downtown a friendly carnival vibe. 
	
	When asked by The Sundial if Carrboro PD experienced any  problems trying to navigate confused drivers or dealing with rambunctious concert-goers, Captain Chris Atack reported, &#x201C;It was a beautiful day and we had no issues.&#x201D;
	
	&#x201C;People were friendly and I got to talk to numerous good folks... Traffic was normal and the music was great,&#x201D; he added. 
	
	One  attendee, James Kobel, told the Sundial that his Sunday afternoon and evening at the CMF was his first major Carrboro event since moving to town about a week earlier. He said that it was &#x201C;probably the most people I&#x2019;ve seen in one place since moving to North Carolina,&#x201D; from New York. &#x201C;Really cool to see how everyone sort of knows each other,&#x201D; he added. 
	
	Early skies provoked jitters that outdoor stages could get rained out for awhile, but by Sunday afternoon a cool breeze that complemented sunshine made lounging about on the field in front of Weaver Street Market a perfect option. 
	
	The Weaver Street Market stage saw a wide range of family-friendly, danceable bands and musicians. Standout performances there included The Drowning Lovers, a &#x201C;lounge-noir&#x201D; act familiar to the Triangle and Chapel Hill music scene of the last 10 years. Singer Meredith Snow has a voice that combines the energy and phrasing of Ani DiFranco and the pitch-perfect intonation of Ella Fitzgerald, while adding just the right amount of kitschy irony to her delivery. She was backed up by her excellent band consisting of Robert Cantrell, John Gillespie, Paul Snow and Lisa Lindsey, whose jazzy, funky accompaniment fit the atmosphere perfectly. 
	
	The Market stage also hosted the psychobilly Americana enthusiasts and Shakori Hills GrassRoots Festival favorite Kittybox and The Johnnys. Lead singer Taz Halloween leads the band, which harkens back to nostalgia acts like Sha Na Na and the  punk weirdness of The Cramps. 
	
	Early in the day at The Station, hillbilly punk band Robobilly performed another of their pop-up revival acts. Such performances have happened a few times since one member moved to Texas, and are becoming more frequent recently, to the delight of fans of stomp-and-holler futurism built around the concept of hill music in a post-civilized future. They were followed on the stage by Server, a rock band full of reverb and surf-paced fuzz. It&#x2019;s the new project of Carrboro&#x2019;s Boogie Reverie, a weird genius of noise with the conceptual visions of a modern Nikola Tesla.
	
	Later in the day, the outdoor stage behind Tyler&#x2019;s Taproom had traditional Cuban rhythms courtesy of Saludos Company, spurring even novice adults to attempt dancing the samba and the cha-cha-cha. 
	
	Tr&#xE9; Mars &amp;amp; The Kids Downtown similarly succeeded, getting a room of timid hipsters to dance to their blend of rap lyricism, a live horn section and guitar. Their stage, the back room at Cat&#x2019;s Cradle, was entirely devoted to regional hip-hop and rap for the festival, starting at 3:30 PM and ending at 10 PM.
	
	Some people and performers were notable for their absence this year. Missing behind the scenes was Jim Dennis, the former organizer and owner of Music Loft on Main Street, which has closed since the previous festival. From 2017 to 2018, the predominating sound has moved along the spectrum from jazz to hard noise. Also absent were previous festival highlights, including musicians from the Red Clay Ramblers, Doug Largent Trio, Carrboro super-glam outfit Fantastico!, and members of Superchunk.
	
	Foodies also had their senses to think of, and not one block within the designated festival boundaries lacked food and beverage trucks or grill tents. For example, the Napoli pizza oven truck was set up away from its usual location on North Greensboro Street, and instead took up the empty lot between Weaver and Main Street, next to the owner&#x2019;s brand-new venture the Napoli Caf&#xE9; &amp;amp; Gelateria, which was serving up decadent frozen treats. 
	
	We&#x2019;ll close our review by paying dues to the ancient art of band names, which can be good, bad, revelatory, so-good-they&#x2019;re-bad, or just plain confusing. There were the conceptual, such as Pretend I&#x2019;m a Genius (indie rock) and Tea Cup Gin (indie jazz/blues/soul); the mysterious, such as Jphon01 (rock/jam) and AZULZ (Latin jazz/R&amp;amp;B); and the punning, such as The Carrborators (Americana), Scandimonium (Nordic roots) and Miss Adventures (folk).
	
	Whether visitors wandered the festival following monikers, genres, their friends or their noses, Carrboro put on a unique show for prior attendees and newcomers alike this past weekend.</body>

    <title>Chief Blue Has 'Great Concern' Over Silent Sam Police Tactics</title>
    <subhead></subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>CHAPEL HILL &#x2014; Police Chief Chris Blue, speaking before the Orange County Human Relations Commission on Monday, characterized as questionable some of the crowd-control tactics used by officers at Silent Sam protest clashes that took place at McCorkle Place over the past month and a half. &lt;br&gt;
	
	Law enforcement methods used on the campus of the University of North Carolina caused the Town of Chapel Hill's police chief "great concern," Blue told the Human Relations Commission on October 1.&lt;br&gt;
	
	Silent Sam, the Confederate memorial statue that presided over the north quad of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, was pulled down by protesters on August 20, the day before fall semester classes began at UNC. Since the incident, protests and counter-protests have flared around the pedestal that once supported the statue of a Confederate infantryman.
	
	&#x201C;We predicted a year or so ago that the issues around Silent Sam would escalate to where they wound up,&#x201D; Blue told the commission. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s clear that some tactics have been employed that are unique for this community, and that have not been seen before in this community, and that causes me great concern.&#x201D;
	
	Blue did not list the tactics police employed; however, pepper spray, tackling and using police bikes to push protesters away were some methods observed by witnesses at protests this year around the statue.
	
	Under the guidelines of established mutual aid agreements (last updated in 2014) Chapel Hill Police and other law enforcement organizations across the state provided assistance to UNC&#x2019;s campus police force.
	
	Much of the criticism around law enforcement agencies' behavior at demonstrations around Silent Sam has targeted the behavior of officers who belong to non-local agencies. The Greensboro Police Department has been singled out for its allegedly aggressive use of force, including the use of pepper spray against activists.
	
	One Triangle law enforcement officer, who asked not to be named, said that he is not surprised by the backlash in Orange County against the use of such non-lethal weaponry. Greensboro police, he said, &#x201C;are used to a very different atmosphere, and people in Greensboro are far less triggered by that tactic.&#x201D; 
	
	The officer added, &#x201C;They only deployed pepper spray when the group attempted to push pass police lines into their command post.&#x201D; He said that he did not believe Blue had any reason to apologize for the tactics used on campus. 
	
	The Sundial reached out the UNC-Chapel Hill Police spokesperson Randy Young, but his office was unavailable for immediate comment. </body>

    <title>Florence Death Toll Pushed Up to 51</title>
    <subhead></subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>NORTH CAROLINA &#x2014; In recent days, more deaths have been associated with Hurricane Florence since the storm's high-velocity winds and intense rains struck the Virginia and Carolina coastline three weeks ago.
	
	As of Sunday morning, the death toll across the three affected states had reached 51, with 39 fatalities in North Carolina. Other Florence-related deaths have been reported in storm-affected areas in South Carolina and Virginia.
	
	The latest additions to the storm's death count were associated with &#xD;
deaths from injuries people sustained while trying to repair damage left&#xD;
 by the storm, which began causing damage in North Carolina on September&#xD;
 13.
	
	Virginia's death toll was increased to three people in recent days after&#xD;
 a state emergency official revised a previously reported statistic. Nine deaths in South Carolina have been associated with Florence.&lt;br&gt;
	
	Governor Roy Cooper released a statement to media outlets last week saying that &#x201C;a 47-year-old man [was] found dead outside a Duplin County residence on Sept. 21 due to a head injury sustained when he fell from a ladder while repairing storm damage.&#x201D;
	
	The most common types of death involved drivers overwhelmed by floodwaters and drowning in their vehicles, with 11 lives lost in that manner. Five more people died in auto accidents attributed to waterlogged roadways.
	
	Additional deaths were caused by the extended power outages, including fires accidentally started by candles; carbon monoxide poisoning from indoor use of gasoline generators; and lung disease complications due to inability to use electricity-dependent oxygen machines. 
	
	Governor Cooper urged the owners of affected homes or damaged property to seek immediate help from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). &#x201C;Applying with FEMA is the single most important thing you can do.&#x201D; Cooper said. &#x201C;If you suffered damage from Florence, make sure you apply for assistance right away.&#x201D;</body>

    <title>Rev. Barber Wins Genius Grant, Arrested in Chicago</title>
    <subhead>North Carolina Social Justice Leader Is MacArthur Recipient</subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>Civil rights leader and North Carolina clergyman William Barber II was awarded the prestigious MacArthur Genius Grant on Thursday, October 4 in recognition of his tenacious social justice activities and prolific writings. In addition to the accolades and the title, Barber was given $625,000 from MacArthur Foundation coffers.
	
	The same day the foundation announced the list of grantees, Barber was in Chicago leading a protest in front of an inner-city McDonald&#x2019;s franchise, demanding an increase in the minimum wage. Hours later, he was arrested by city police officers for allegedly participating in an unlawful assembly. 
	
	Barber is perhaps best known to Triangle residents as the founder of the Moral Monday protests and civil disobedience actions at the NC General Assembly in Raleigh that started in 2013. The campaign was a reaction to the swath of policies regarding abortion, voting rights and the environment that Republican-led legislature had passed. 
	
	In 2006, Barber became president of the NAACP's North Carolina chapter, which is the largest in the South and the second-largest in the country after Detroit. He is also the chair of the organization&#x2019;s Legislative Political Action Committee, as well as the pastor of Greenleaf Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), in Goldsboro.
	
	 
	
	According to its website, the MacArthur grant is not considered a lifetime achievement award, but &#x201C;an investment in a person&#x2019;s originality, insight, and potential. Indeed, the purpose of the MacArthur Fellows Program is to enable recipients to exercise their own creative instincts for the benefit of human society.&#x201D;
	
	Upon hearing the news, former Vice President Al Gore issued public congratulations via Twitter. &#x201C;Dr. Barber is an exceptional leader. Nobody is more deserving,&#x201D; Gore said.
	
	The MacArthur Foundation usually picks between 20 and 30 individuals every year, and never accepts unsolicited nominations or recommendations. Former MacArthur fellows from North Carolina include Carolina Chocolate Drops lead singer Rhiannon Giddens, former News &amp;amp; Observer journalist Nikole Hannah-Jones and tap dancer Michelle Dorrance, who was raised in Chapel Hill. </body>

    <title>Tropical Storm Michael Cuts Power, Stops Travel in Triangle</title>
    <subhead></subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>CARRBORO &#x2014; Less than one month after Hurricane Florence struck the East coast of the Carolinas, the powerful storm Michael found its way to the Triangle, this time by way of the Gulf of Mexico through Georgia. And while the severity of Michael &#x2014;  downgraded from hurricane to tropical storm in the early hours of Thursday, October 11 &#x2014; did not reach that of its predecessor, a total of 13 people were killed as a result &#x2014; five in Virginia, four in Florida, three in North Carolina and one in Georgia &#x2014; and residents have had their daily lives affected throughout the state.
	
	A little before 11 AM Thursday morning, reports of road closures in western NC trickled in on social media and news outlets. Sixteen roadways were shut down as a result of Michael, primarily in Polk, Ashe and Watauga counties, according to the state&#x2019;s Department of Transportation website and Twitter page.
	
	Those who had scheduled flights out of Raleigh-Durham International Airport on American Airlines or JetBlue found that the airlines have canceled a majority of their afternoon and evening flights on Thursday. Both United Airlines and Air Canada also decided to cancel a small number of departures. RDU officials instructed travelers to call airlines  ahead of time before leaving for the airport. 
	
	Most residents of Durham, Orange and Wake counties expected moderate to heavy rain through the morning of Friday, October 12 because both local and national forecasts predicted precipitation from 7 PM to 9 PM. However the skies were clear at sunrise Friday and have stayed that way.
	
	Power outages in downtown Carrboro were first reported between 4:30 PM and 5:30 PM, with two large commercial-zone blocks at the corner of Main Street and Greensboro Street experiencing a complete blackout until the very early hours of Friday, October 12. Both the Harris Teeter at 300 North Greensboro, and its neighbor Carr Mill Mall were plunged into darkness around 4:45 PM, and all customers were asked to leave the property.
	
	The Duke Energy website reported that over 10 thousand customers remained without power in Orange County as of 12:30 PM Friday afternoon. A Duke Energy representative told the Sundial that it may be two to four days before every business and household is back online.  
	
	Piedmont Electric had 12 thousand customers in Orange County still without power as of 12:45 PM.
	
	The New York Times and CNN both pegged the total number of customers across all seven affected states without electricity at 1.27 million at 1 PM on Friday.
	
	In Durham, Boylan Avenue at South Street and Lenoir Street lost all power early Thursday evening. North Wilmington Street lost power within three square residential blocks, but no traffic lights went out. Blount Street at Jones Street and Lane Street lost all electricity, including traffic lights. Person Street at  Jones Street and Lane Street lost all power as well. Detours for commuters will be likely for all of Friday, so drivers should plan accordingly.
	
	Officials with the Alamance-Burlington School System, Chapel Hill&#x2013;Carrboro City Schools, Chatham County Public School System, Durham Public Schools and Orange County Schools contacted students and faculty Thursday night to announce public school closures on Friday. Durham Technical Community College also cancelled all scheduled Friday classes. </body>

    <title>Power Outages Persist in Triangle</title>
    <subhead></subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>CARRBORO &#x2014; Workers and administrators with major North Carolina energy companies serving Orange, Durham and Chatham Counties have been working overtime Friday to restore power to thousands of customers in the Triangle, where homes, businesses, streetlights and traffic signals were knocked out after tropical storm Michael passed over the region on Thursday. The weekend may still see some homes without power.
	
	Some 319,000 Duke Energy customers in North Carolina remained without power Friday afternoon, with an estimated total of 321,000 households and businesses combined in North and South Carolina still experiencing blackout Friday. 
	
	A day after ploughing over the Florida panhandle with winds in excess of 150 miles per hour, tropical storm Michael crossed the Piedmont moving northeast on Thursday (October 11). Michael was a Category 4 hurricane when it made landfall in Florida and for some of its journey as it tore through Georgia. It was downgraded to a tropical storm, then hit South Carolina and North Carolina with heavy rain and gale-force winds that felled trees and tree limbs, causing damage power lines, vehicles, and structures. 
	
	Outages reported by Piedmont Electric Membership Corporation (PEMC) have hit Orange County heavier than its neighbors, with 9,593 members still waiting for service. PEMC outages stand at 623 in Durham County and 36 in Chatham as of 4 PM. 
	
	PEMC representative Brandon Reed told the Sundial via phone that numbers are likely to fluctuate throughout the rest of the day as members who left town to avoid Michael return to find their homes without power. &#x201C;There actually could be a lot of things that make those numbers go up and down,&#x201D; Reed said, including loose tree limbs finally snapping after hours of harsh weather. 
	
	&#x201C;What we&#x2019;re telling our members is that they should have power again in one to three days,&#x201D; Reed continued. &#x201C;We know that it&#x2019;s a wide range, but we&#x2019;re doing everything we can, including bringing in outside crews.&#x201D;
	
	PEMC, which services sections of Orange and Durham Counties as well as Chatham and Alamance, supplies its customers with an interactive power outage &lt;a href="http://outageviewer.pemc.org:88/" target="_blank"&gt;map &lt;/a&gt; that updates itself every 15 minutes as new information is entered into the system. 
	
	At 3:10 PM, the map was reporting 17,041 members still waiting for their service to be restored, down from 22,709 &#x2014; the total number affected as a result of tropical storm-related complications. 
	
	In an email sent out to active PEMC customers, the utility company reported was reported that &#x201C;at the peak of the outages, more than 70 percent of our members were without power.&#x201D;
	
	Duke Energy reported that in North Carolina and South Carolina, 560,000 affected members had power restored to them as of 3:30 PM Friday. 
	
	&#x201C;The best way for customers to get an estimate for [service restoration] is to text &#x2018;OUT&#x2019; to 578-01,&#x201D; said Anne McGovern, who works in media relations for Duke Energy. &#x201C;What that does is it allows them to get messages from us, so when we do have an ETR [estimated time of restoration] they will get a text which alert them to that.&#x201D;
	
	&#x201C;I want to make sure that people know we are working as hard and as quickly and safely as we can,&#x201D; McGovern said. &#x201D;We&#x2019;ve got 9 thousand workers in the Carolinas right now trying to restore power.&#x201D;</body>

    <title>Maya Little, Silent Sam Protester, Guilty but Free; Carr's Descendant Asks for More</title>
    <subhead>Julian Carr's Great-Great-Great Grandaughter Wants "Antiracist Activists" Free of Charges</subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>CHAPEL HILL &#x2014; A descendent of Julian Shakespeare Carr, the Gilded Age industrialist who dedicated the recently toppled Civil War memorial on UNC&#x2019;s campus, has sent a letter to UNC administrators urging that they drop complaints against activist and Ph.D. candidate Maya Little, who was arrested for defacing the statue in April, and other &#x201C;antiracist activists&#x201D; involved in protests after.
	
	Little threw a mixture of red ink and her own blood on the statue of a Confederate infantryman known as Silent Sam. On Monday, October 15, she appeared in Orange County District Court Monday to answer a misdemeanor charge of defacing public property. Judge Samantha Cabe found Little guilty by her own admission and issued a &#x201C;prayer for judgment&#x201D; that will prevent Little from being sentenced. Her court fees were also waived, according to the Associated Press and organization Defend UNC, which has been raising money to defend Silent Sam protesters. 
	
	Little still faces Honor Court charges at the school related to her defacement of the statue.
	
	Meanwhile on Friday, October 12, Chancellor Carol Folt issued an official &lt;a href="https://www.unc.edu/posts/2018/10/12/at-university-day-folt-issues-apology-calls-for-purposeful-action-moving-forward/" target="_blank"&gt;apology &lt;/a&gt; on the university&#x2019;s behalf for its participation in slavery.
	
	Meg Yarnell, a social worker living in California who has identified herself as Carr&#x2019;s great-great-great granddaughter, penned an open letter to the &#x201C;UNC Administration&#x201D; in an effort to dissuade them from moving forward with the criminal charges and an Honor Court inquiry. It was made public Monday, October 15, before the judge's decision in Little's case.
	
	&#x201C;My family can trace our lineage in the United States back to early America and the shameful time when our ancestors owned slaves, a time when it was perfectly acceptable, even enviable, for one man and his kin to become rich off the unpaid labor, industry, and suffering of hundreds of men, women and children,&#x201D; Yarnell wrote in her letter.
	
	Yarnell told the Sundial that while her work and family obligations prevent her from coming to North Carolina to play a larger role in campus protests against the statue, whose existence has been a source of controversy on UNC&#x2019;s campus since the Civil Rights movement, she said that she feels &#x201C;a certain connection to Maya Little...and if there was more that I could do, I would love that.&#x201D;
	
	After opening arguments in Little&#x2019;s trial Monday, the prosecution called on officers from the Chapel Hill Police Department and UNC Police to offer testimony against Little. This was followed by the introduction as evidence of police bodycam footage which captured the vandalism in progress.
	
	The defense's roster included the expert testimony of a UNC African American history professor, and eyewitness accounts from multiple students. Little chose to testify on her own behalf, never denying that she committed the crime.
	
	At the conclusion of the trial, Judge Cabe found Little to be guilty by her own admission. Instead of issuing a punitive sentence, Cabe invoked a judicial technique known as a prayer for judgement continued. This ruling allowed Cabe to "continue the judgment" and prevent a finding of guilt from entering into the court record. 
	
	&#x201C;Maya's action in April 2018 was a courageous act of civil disobedience and an attempt to ameliorate the harm that white people have done,&#x201D; Yarnell wrote in her letter to UNC administrators. &#x201C;She generated thoughtful discussion around issues of white supremacy at her own expense. Those that participated in the actions against the statue in August and early September also sought to turn the tides on campus to discussions of racial inclusion and social justice. I stand proudly with them.&#x201D;
	
	Silent Sam, the figure of an unnamed Confederate soldier, which stood for more than a century in McCorkle Place as a memorial to those students who fought in the Civil War, was toppled by protestors on August 20. UNC-Chapel Hill Chancellor Carol Folt faces a decision of whether the school will spend any money to restore the toppled figure of the Confederate infantryman to its marble pedestal. 
	
	&#x201C;UNC is in a unique position at this moment in time,&#x201D; Yarnell wrote. &#x201C;Silent Sam has been removed. In its absence, the university can reimagine the commemorative landscape to represent the community&#x2019;s highest values.&#x201D;
	
	Carr is a historical figure &lt;a href="https://piedmontsundial.com/calendar/calendar_main_article.php?theArticle=107" target="_blank"&gt;repeatedly cited&lt;/a&gt; by those arguing for the statue&#x2019;s permanent removal. His inflammatory and bigoted speech at the Silent Sam dedication ceremony in June 1913 is pointed to as proof that the memorial was built not simply to honor fallen students, but to reinforce Jim Crow racial hierarchies. 
	
	In his 1913 speech, Carr stated, &#x201C;The present generation, I am persuaded, scarcely takes note of what the Confederate soldier meant to the welfare of the Anglo Saxon race during the four years immediately succeeding the war, when the facts are, that their courage and steadfastness saved the very life of the Anglo Saxon race in the South.&#x201D; 
	
	During the same speech, Carr spoke nostalgically of whipping a black woman in Chapel Hill not long after the Civil War, because she had &#x201C;insulted and maligned a Southern lady, and then rushed for protection to these University buildings where was stationed a garrison of 100 Federal soldiers. I performed the pleasing duty in the immediate presence of the entire garrison, and for thirty nights afterwards slept with a double-barrel shot gun under my head.&#x201D; 
	
	Carr was also head of the commission to oversee the installment of a Confederate memorial in Durham in the 1920s, which was also supported by the United Daughters of the Confederacy (UDF) chapter named after him. He resigned from the commission in 1923 because the state government did not increase its funding for the statue. A statue was till provided in front of the Durham County Courthouse, albeit a cheaper, mass-produced model. It was pulled down by protesters in August of 2017.
	
	Carr was also a noted philanthropist who funded the preservation of Trinity College and other community causes during his lifetime. He is the namesake of the Town of Carrboro, whose Board of Aldermen is considering adding an educational &#x201C;truth plaque&#x201D; about his past somewhere public.
	
	Yarnell told the Sundial that she wanted to support Little&#x2019;s cause, and reached out to Silent Sam protestors.
	
	&#x201C;I asked if there was some way I could help support them, and they suggested that I write a letter,&#x201D; Yarnell said. &#x201C;Then I spoke to some of my own family members and decided I felt strongly about this.&#x201D;
	
	The letter (reprinted, in full below) includes Yarnell&#x2019;s denunciation of Julian Shakespeare Carr&#x2019;s documented racism, stating, &#x201C;It is a horrifying necessity to confront the reality that my ancestors participated in such shameful things, and I want to express my sorrow and deepest apologies for the profound suffering, trauma and inequality caused by the actions of my ancestors, including Julian Carr.&#x201D; 
	
	Yarnell told the Sundial that while Julian Shakespeare Carr did loom large in her family history, &#x201C;to be honest with you, most of my relatives who would remember him fondly are dead.&#x201D; She added, &#x201C;As white people, we have a responsibility to speak out when we see injustice.&#x201D;
	
	&lt;br&gt;
	
	&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;An Open Letter to the UNC Administration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;I write to you, as the great, great, great granddaughter of Julian S. Carr, to advocate that UNC drop the Honor Court and criminal charges against Maya Little and the antiracist activists arrested protesting the Confederate monument known as Silent Sam. Considering the legacy of my great, great, great grandfather, who was instrumental in erecting Silent Sam and infamously dedicated the statue by celebrating the purity of the Anglo-Saxon race and the time that he &#x201C;whipped a negro wench until her skirt hung in shreds,&#x201D; I am grateful for what Maya did to contextualize this statue and advance the cause for its removal.
	
	My family can trace our lineage in the United States back to early America and the shameful time when our ancestors owned slaves, a time when it was perfectly acceptable, even enviable, for one man and his kin to become rich off the unpaid labor, industry, and suffering of hundreds of men, women and children.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;My great, great, great grandfather Julian Carr fought in the Civil War on side of the Confederacy, which explicitly dedicated itself to keeping this system of slavery alive. Yes, he loved his family and parts of the community in which he lived, but we must recognize that Julian was a white supremacist whose vitriolic speech and actions resulted in the pain and suffering of many.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;As a white person, and descendant of Julian Carr, I cannot remain silent. Our silence as white people is complicity with white supremacy and has created a very painful world. It is a horrifying necessity to confront the reality that my ancestors participated in such shameful things, and I want to express my sorrow and deepest apologies for the profound suffering, trauma and inequality caused by the actions of my ancestors, including Julian Carr. However, apologies are not enough. Action is needed to help right these historic wrongs.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;As Frederick Douglass said during an 1881 speech, &#x201C;Slavery is indeed gone, but its long, black shadow yet falls broad and large over the face of the whole country.&#x201D; This continues to be true today.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;The founding of our country is circumscribed by multiple traumas of oppression and violence&#x2014;slavery of Black people and genocide of First Nations peoples among them. As a nation we have failed to truly understand, acknowledge, mourn, and make reparations for our country&#x2019;s violent origins.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;This untreated wound is why is so difficult to talk about race and culture in America. It is one of the reasons we do not make meaningful headway on so many of societies&#x2019; problems such as poverty, institutional racism, police brutality, the prison industrial complex, and health inequality. It is why we continue to hold onto racist and damaging memorials such as the one torn down at UNC.
	
	By our &#x201C;founding fathers&#x2019;&#x201D; design, white people have benefitted and continue to benefit from slavery and its contemporary semblances. As white people, we need to confront our past and take responsibility for creating real socioeconomic and racial equity and justice today. For one, we need to use the privilege history has afforded us to speak the truth and remove Confederate monuments like Silent Sam, which only serve to celebrate our nation&#x2019;s ugly past and present. We should applaud the actions of Maya Little and other antiracists activists, many of whom are people of color, for putting themselves at risk to improve our communities.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Maya's action in April 2018 was a courageous act of civil disobedience and an attempt to ameliorate the harm that white people have done. She generated thoughtful discussion around issues of white supremacy at her own expense. Those that participated in the actions against the statue in August and early September also sought to turn the tides on campus to discussions of racial inclusion and social justice. I stand proudly with them.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;UNC is in a unique position at this moment in time. Silent Sam has been removed. In its absence, the university can reimagine the commemorative landscape to represent the community&#x2019;s highest values. UNC can create a campus that is welcoming for all and in the spirit of its mission to serve as a center for research, scholarship, and creativity for a diverse community of undergraduate, graduate, and professional students to become the next generation of leaders.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Maya Little, as well as those involved in removing and protesting the statue, are some of these leaders. It would be another wound to silence or make invisible (or worse, violently eradicate) their actions, which have put UNC&#x2019;s community and our nation in a greater place to collectively heal. &lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Sincerely,
	
	Meg Yarnell&lt;br&gt;</body>

    <title>Orange, Anson and Union County Residents Now Eligible for Florence FEMA Relief</title>
    <subhead></subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>RALEIGH &#x2014; The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) announced on Monday, October, 15 that owners of residential and commercial properties in Orange, Anson and Union counties are now eligible for financial relief on any uninsured or underinsured damages incurred as the result of Hurricane Florence.

    <title>Mayors Past and Present Discuss a Town&#x2019;s Racist Namesake</title>
    <subhead></subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>CARRBORO &#x2014; If industrialist Julian Shakespeare Carr&#x2019;s dedication speech in 1913 was vile enough to topple a Civil War memorial statue more than one hundred years later, could his words be repugnant enough to also change a North Carolina town&#x2019;s present-day name?
	
	Carrboro, the town of 20,000 that shares a downtown business district with Chapel Hill,  is even more publicly bedeviled by the documented racism of Carr (1845&#x2013;1924) than the university town next door where protestors at the University of North Carolina toppled the Civil War memorial statue known as Silent Sam on August 20. &lt;br&gt;
	
	A similar discussion is happening at Duke University in nearby Durham, where administrators are considering taking Carr&#x2019;s name off a history building; Carr Hall was named for the wealthy mill owner whose philanthropy helped move Trinity College to what is now Duke University East Campus in 1892.
	
	The town of Carrboro, formerly called Venable, Lloydsville and West End, was renamed for Carr in 1913, the same year he bragged that he had &#x201C;horse-whipped a Negro wench&#x201D; soon after his return from Appomattox. 
	
	On October 15, Carrboro&#x2019;s current mayor, Lydia Lavelle, and five previous Carrboro mayors held a public meeting where they discussed how the town should address the matter of its controversial namesake. 
	
	The possibility of a name change as well as swapping affiliations from Julian for a more honorable historical figure with the same surname were both discussed. More than 40 members of the public attended the meeting in the Carrboro Century Center, a multipurpose meeting hall complex and &#x201C;cyber library&#x201D; in the heart of downtown Carrboro at 100 N. Greensboro Street.
	
	It would not be the first time the town has changed its name; in 1882, Carrboro was known as West End, reflecting its location relative to Chapel Hill. At the beginning of the 20th century, it was briefly designated Lloydsville in honor of mill proprietor Thomas Lloyd. The name changed yet again in 1911, becoming the town of Venable, after University of North Carolina president Francis Venable. In 1913, after Julian Carr brought electricity to the area, the town&#x2019;s name was changed to Carrboro. 
	
	State law prohibits the Board of Aldermen from voting to change Carrboro&#x2019;s current name to a new one, as that would require a revised charter of incorporation. The process would likely require state legislative approval. 
	
	&#x201C;You change it to something besides Carrboro, you&#x2019;re really asking to be interfered with by the state legislature,&#x201D; said former mayor Mark Chilton at the meeting. &#x201C;And it won&#x2019;t be for the best.&#x201D; 
	
	In May, Board of Aldermen member Jacquelyn Gist proposed a &#x201C;truth plaque&#x201D; about Carr that would address his past, which includes business, philanthropy and racism that at least once became violent. Gist told the Sundial then, "We really can't change our name, and there are a lot of logistical and financial reasons why that would be difficult."
	
	The panel of former mayors met at the Century Center in awareness of those challenges, and was purposefully convened during National Planning Month as part of meetings about the town&#x2019;s future. The organizer&#x2019;s hopes are to find a way forward that is logistically feasible and fitting of the desires of Carrboro residents. 
	
	Chilton and Lavelle  suggested a few alternative namesakes, including the civil rights activist Johnnie Carr, a major figure of the successful 1955 Montgomery, Alabama (her birthplace) bus boycott; and the more locally connected Elias Carr, who served as the 48th Governor of North Carolina from 1893 to 1897 and whose name already adorns a building on the UNC-Chapel Hill campus. 
	
	The moral implication of dissociating the town&#x2019;s legacy from that of Julian Shakespeare Carr was driven home by Bob Drakeford, the only African-American person to be elected mayor in the town&#x2019;s history, who served from 1977 to 1983. 
	
	Drakeford noted that during the Jim Crow era, Carrboro was well-known to black North Carolinians as a &#x201C;sundown town,&#x201D; where a non-white person walking about town past dusk was risking their life.  
	
	 The topics also included broader discussion on the history of Carrboro and the range of experiences of each former mayor. 
	
	James Porto told the crowd that, during his term (1983-1987), the idea of merging Chapel Hill and Carrboro into a single municipality as a cost-saving measure was treated as a possibility. 
	
	That suggestion was met with some boos, hisses and a little bit of laughter from the audience, demonstrating that by whatever name, the identity of a distinct township remained important to those gathered. 
	
	Chapel Hill&#x2019;s university-town politics and amenities do not inform the distinct flavor of Carrboro. A blend of artisan and techie lifestyles, competitive public schools, local artistry and liberal politics help define this micro-urban community at the western corner of the Triangle Region.
	
	Partly by virtue of its small area, Carrboro boasts the greatest population density of any North Carolina municipality. Critically praised cuisine includes the Oakleaf, Acme Food &amp;amp; Beverage Co., Akai Hana and Provence; breweries include Steel String, Starpoint and Vecino brewing companies. The town has numerous music venues to support a strong artistic scene, the most well-known among them being Cat&#x2019;s Cradle. &lt;br&gt;

    <title>Durham&#x2019;s Northgate Mall Faces Possible Foreclosure</title>
    <subhead></subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>DURHAM &#x2014; Northgate Mall may be near the end of its 58-year run, as news surfaced this past week that the Durham retail landmark may face foreclosure in the near future after defaulting on two promissory notes recently purchased by the New York investment firm Northwood Investors. 
	
	Northwood, a company claiming close to $7 billion in national and international assets, bought the mall&#x2019;s Sears building in June of this year when Sears shut down 72 of its locations nationwide. Later that same month, Northwood acquired $62 million dollars of debt owed to creditors by the mall&#x2019;s parent company, Northgate Associates. 
	
	A document filed by a Durham County Superior Court assistant clerk on Wednesday, October 17 formally granted Northwood permission to initiate the foreclosure proceedings, although the filing stipulated that they are forbidden from placing all or part of the property on the open market until December 14.
	
	The regional shopping center, located off I-85 at Gregson Street, opened in 1960 as an open-air strip mall; to stay competitive, the owners constructed an enclosed plaza with department stores on either end in 1973. It expanded further in 1986 by adding a food court and taking on more national chain stores as tenants. 
	
	The early 2000s marked the beginning of a slow decline in customer traffic and tenant revenue for Northgate. Perceptions of the mall&#x2019;s safety suffered from a series of violent gang-related incidents, including a fatal stabbing there in 2007.  The Streets at Southpoint, a shopping mega-complex south of I-40 in Durham, opened in 2002.  
	
	Long-time fixture Macy&#x2019;s shuttered its department store at Northgate in 2017 after making a deal with Duke University to sell the property for $4.5 million, according to county property records reported by the Herald Sun.
	
	Urbanist and development consultant Paco Underhill, author of the books &#x201C;Call of the Mall&#x201D;, and &#x201C;Why We Buy: The Science of Shopping&#x201D;, told the Sundial that the dissolution of Northgate fits into a nationwide failures of malls that were built in the 1960s and 1970s.
	
	 
	
	&#x201C;Part of what the problem is, if you look at most U.S. malls, they are based on fashion and gifts, and they&#x2019;re not complete solutions,&#x201D; he said. If anything can save them, Underhill says, it is the undeveloped parking space around them. &#x201C;All across the world when somebody looks at an ageing shopping mall, they&#x2019;re going, &#x2018;Give me two years and half a billion dollars, and I can put housing, offices and hotels into those parking lots&#x2019; to bring in the customers needed for survival.&#x201D; Tarmac would become marketable real estate, and parking for those customers would be put into taller, more space-efficient parking garages.
	
	&#x201C;A very interesting issue when it comes to the Research Triangle is that there is a generation of millennials who would like to live, work and shop in the same place,&#x201D; said Underhill.
	
	Northwood hired prominent attorney Louis E. Wooten III, of the Raleigh-based Wooten Law Firm, to act as substitute trustee; Wooten&#x2019;s website claims that he and his associates have been handling foreclosure cases in the Triangle and central North Carolina for over two decades, and have handled cases of &#x201C;all sizes, including one in which the secured debt was more than $80 [million].&#x201D;
	
	Whether Northgate&#x2019;s new owners will build on the existing infrastructure or replace it with something different remains to be seen. </body>

    <title>Three More Plead to Wake County Cash Skimming</title>
    <subhead></subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>RALEIGH &#x2014; Three former staffers from the Wake County Register of Deeds Office pleaded guilty to embezzlement on Friday, October 26, in separate cases of theft that investigators say is related to more than $2 million missing from that office.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Murray Parker, Troy Ellis and Veronica Gearon were each sentenced to jail time and hefty fines for stealing separate amounts totaling $205,000. That sum is less than a fifth of the money prosecutors say was stolen from Wake County and its taxpayers through the office of the Register of Deeds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An insurance investigation in 2017 revealed an estimated $2.3 million was missing from the Wake County Register of Deeds Office over a nine-year period.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Laura Riddick, the former register of deeds, was convicted in August of having siphoned $926,000 from her office into personal accounts. Riddick was sentenced to a minimum of five years imprisonment and ordered to repay the money. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of the three former staffers sentenced Friday, the longest sentence was given to Parker, who will be imprisoned for 12 to 24 months. District Attorney Lorrin Freeman told the court that Parker was Riddick&#x2019;s &#x201C;right-hand person,&#x201D; and the only other government worker privy to Riddick&#x2019;s scheme. Parker has repaid the $74,067 he admitted to stealing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gearon and Ellis may have acted independently of each other, and of Riddick and Parker, in their embezzlements. Gearon, who stole $80,950, received an eight- to 12-month active sentence and will have to repay that sum.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ellis will spend 45 days in jail and repay $21,660, roughly half of what prosecutors say he is estimated to have skimmed in small increments from office cash drawers. Unlike his colleagues, Ellis never deposited public money into a personal bank account, and told the court he spent it primarily on jewelry and electronics. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All three former Wake County employees who pleaded guilty Friday offered apologizes to Superior Court Judge Becky Holt and to the people of Wake County for their actions. Each will face multiple years of probation after serving their sentences. &lt;br&gt;</body>

    <title>Silent Sam Vandal Given Warning, Community Service by Honor Court</title>
    <subhead></subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>CHAPEL HILL &#x2014; Maya Little, a history PhD candidate and antiracism activist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, appeared before a five-member student panel on Thursday, October 25 and Friday, October 26, being accused of violating the school's Honor Code by intentionally damaging public property when she threw a mixture of her blood and red ink on the statue of a Confederate soldier on April 30 this year. 
	
	At the culmination of a two-day hearing, the school's Graduate and Professional Honor Court declared Little responsible for the act of vandalism, considered to be in violation of the honor code signed by all students upon matriculation. Student investigative counsel Philip Pullen told the panel that it took 60 hours and $4,000 to completely clean the statue after Little&#x2019;s action.
	
	UNC has two honor courts, the Undergraduate Honor Court and the Graduate and Professional Honor Court. According to printed information from the Office of Student Conduct, "The two Courts are charged with reviewing allegations of &#xD;
student academic and non-academic misconduct to determine if the Honor &#xD;
Code was violated. If the respective Court determines a violation &#xD;
&amp;nbsp;occurred, it imposes disciplinary sanctions consistent with community &#xD;
values and University guidelines." &lt;br&gt;
	
	The honor court's punishment for Little includes 18 hours of community service to be completed within a period of 90 days, and an official &#x201C;warning letter.&#x201D; The sanctions were significantly less draconian than those requested by students acting as prosecuting counsel, who asked for 60 service hours as well as an academic probation period for Little&#x2019;s entire spring semester. 
	
	Little walked out of the hearing before the verdict and its accompanying sanctions were read aloud at the end of Friday&#x2019;s proceedings. She addressed a group of supporters outside the courtroom, saying, &#x201C;I do not believe the honor court aims to give me a fair and impartial trial.&#x201D; 
	
	Little&#x2019;s defiance was rooted in her objection to law student Frank Pray&#x2019;s inclusion on the panel. Pray is vocal campus conservative and was publicly critical of the effort to remove Silent Sam. In the past, he has directed multiple derisive Twitter comments at student and faculty protesters. On Friday, Little accused him of sanitizing his social media presence by &#x201C;deleting comments...in order to appear less political.&#x201D;  
	
	On October 15, Little was &lt;a href="https://piedmontsundial.com/calendar/calendar_main_article.php?theArticle=191" target="_blank"&gt;found guilty&lt;/a&gt; of a misdemeanor vandalism charge by an Orange County judge for the same incident. That court did not hand down a punitive sentence or formally convict Little, issuing rather &#x201C;a prayer of judgment.&#x201D; &lt;br&gt;
	
	Silent Sam, the statue of a Confederate infantryman commemorating UNC students who took up arms in the Civil War, was toppled by protestors on August 20 of this year. &lt;br&gt;

    <title>Ghostly Haunts in the Triangle</title>
    <subhead></subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>Looking for a fun-scary destination this Halloween? Or a spooky place to &#x201C;monster mash&#x201D; on your first date? Maybe you want to avoid the calamitous crowds of the costumed on Franklin Street... So take a midnight stroll this October 31 instead to the Carolina Inn, The Horace Williams House, the Devil&#x2019;s Tramping Ground or Raleigh&#x2019;s historic Mordecai House; all four have had repeated sightings of both friendly and malevolent spirits, some dating back at least a century.  
	
	Not all ghosts favor the antebellum period or go for Victorian drapes. If you'd rather rock to ghosts than walk with them, why not listen to a band of zombies jam out on coffinmaking tools and overdrive electric guitars? At Chapel Hill&#x2019;s oldest haunt, some of the area&#x2019;s finest musicians will come together at the Cave for a raucous Halloween party sure to wake the dead.
	
	The Sundial has the details of local Halloween destinations below.
	
	&lt;br&gt;
	
	&lt;b&gt;Carolina Inn&lt;/b&gt;
	
	The 94-year-old hotel located just across the street from the University of North Carolina campus, at 211 Pittsboro Street, is not just a popular wedding reception locale, but also a noteworthy paranormal hotspot.
	
	Specifically, the building is the playground of the disembodied spirit of Dr. William Jacocks, who lived at the Carolina Inn for the better part of two decades, making his residence one of the longest ever there. His stay lasted from 1948 until 1965 when he passed away on the premises in Room 256 (formerly 252). By all accounts, he was an affable man with a lively sense of humor.
	
	Those guests claiming encounters with Jacocks&#x2019; ghost, typically after spending the night in his old chamber, report pranks like being locked out of the room and mysterious plumbing issues. According to the Carolina Inn web brochure, an investigator of the supernatural once witnessed the two sink fixture handles fall off without having been touched, spraying the entire room with water. Over the years, staff members are said to have witnessed his apparition, described as a portly silhouette appearing at the ends of dimly lit hallways, though it always disappeared when attention was to it. Bizarre rapid changes in temperature and rattling door handles have also been attested to by patrons and employees of the hotel.
	
	Carolina Inn is on the must-visit list of any serious tourist of supernatural haunts visiting the Triangle. Amenities available to non-guests include the Crossroads Chapel Hill restaurant and bar.
	
	&lt;br&gt;
	
	&lt;b&gt;Horace Williams House&lt;/b&gt;
	
	UNC philosophy professor Horace Williams was born in 1858 in Gates County, North Carolina. His father was a country doctor with no formal post-secondary education or medical degree. After receiving a bachelor&#x2019;s degree from UNC in 1878, Williams went on to study at Yale Divinity School, then briefly taught lower-level philosophy courses at Harvard before heading back to his alma mater. His life as an academic and town socialite was interesting enough to lead to his likeness being included  in both fiction and nonfiction works. Robert Watson Winston wrote a not-so-accurate biography of him titled &#x201C;Horace Williams: Gadfly of Chapel Hill&#x201D;, and he also made an appearance in Thomas Wolfe's modernist classic &#x201C;Look Homeward, Angel&#x201D; as the character Professor Vergil Weldon.
	
	Williams willed his estate to the UNC philosophy department in 1940, and it has since been converted into a museum. And a haunted museum at that, as his ghost is said to have been sighted by employees and visitors on many occasions over the past 80 years. His presence has been marked by the spontaneous movement of milk bottles, water faucets, chairs and doors. Triangle area newspapers reported accounts of paranormal occurrences at the Williams house as far back as 1944. One Daily Tar Heel piece published in 1998 included this quote from a one-time resident of the house: &#x201C;It was not a scary presence&#x2026;[but] we all felt it.&#x201D; 
	
	&lt;br&gt;
	
	&lt;b&gt;Devil's Tramping Ground&lt;/b&gt;
	
	This small, round and barren patch of forest floor is located in Bear Creek, about 30 miles outside of Chapel Hill&amp;nbsp;&#x2014; and has a good deal of bizarre folklore attached to its history. Although exactly when it was discovered is hard to pinpoint, legend has it that Mephisto himself "tramps" this circle of ground, 40 feet in diameter, and personally cast demonic spells to prevent any vegetation from growing within its border.
	
	A host of unconfirmed rumors of strangeness have been circulating for a century among the Chatham County residents who were brave enough to study the phenomenon. One particularly Lovecraftian legend involves people who slept on the Tramping Ground overnight, leading to a disintegration of their sanity and continuing bouts of madness for the rest of their lives. Other adventurers have reported weird figures, described as &#x201C;shadow people,&#x201D; spying on them from the nearby brush. Local occult enthusiasts have supposedly etched pentagrams in the dirt to perform ritual magic in the hopes of rousing Satan from beneath the earth. 
	
	Greensboro Daily News editor John William Harden once wrote this of the area: &#x201C;I have heard that boy scouts spent the night there and woke up with their tents a few miles away... Men [who] attempted to stay up all night were lulled to sleep by a soft voice.&#x201D; 
	
	&lt;br&gt;
	
	&lt;b&gt;Mordecai House&lt;/b&gt;
	
	Constructed in 1785, the Mordecai House is a popular historical landmark and attraction in Raleigh, located in the middle of Mordecai Historic Park next to the Historic Oakwood neighborhood. The house is named after Moses Mordecai, who married the daughter of its first owner, Henry Lane, and paid for the construction of additions in the 1820s. The patriarch of the Mordecai family (also named Moses) emigrated to North Carolina from Germany in the mid-18th century, making the Mordecais one of the first 300 Jewish families in the United States.
	
	To this day, the Mordecai House is the oldest residential building in Raleigh, still sitting atop its original foundation. The surrounding park also includes the birthplace of the first American president to be impeached, Andrew Johnson, and the Ellen Mordecai Garden. The house is said to be haunted by the ghost of Mary Willis Mordecai Turk, who resided on the property during the 19th century. Those claiming to have seen her apparition tend to describe her wearing Victorian garb, or playing the antique piano in the first-floor drawing room, enveloped by a grey mist. The reputation for spooky occurrences at the house got it featured on season two of the SYFY Channel&#x2019;s paranormal &#x201C;reality&#x201D; show &#x201C;Ghost Hunters&#x201D;.
	
	&lt;br&gt;
	
	&lt;b&gt;The Cave&lt;/b&gt;
	
	Chapel Hill&#x2019;s oldest rock club, which opened in 1968 and closed in the spring of 2018, rose from the dead this summer after Melissa Swingle and Autumn Spencer took over the shuttered, subterranean venue at 452 West Franklin Street.&amp;nbsp;
	
	Like a pair of funky Dr. Frankensteins, the pair have sparked new life into the club with the grottolike ceiling, where the likes of R.E.M. and Lyle Lovett once rocked and crooned on their ways to stardom, and hovered over the video arcade when not onstage. The place is full of old ghosts and forgotten rock-&#x2019;n&#x2019;-roll memories. 
	
	With its basement-laboratory walls and red-shift lighting, the Cave gives off a Halloween vibe any night of the year. But a special party is planned for this All Hallows&#x2019; Eve, where the Halloween Party with Crystal Bright and the Silver Hands will kick off at 8 PM with a monster mash of musical veterans, including Katharine Whalen, the Billie-Holiday voice behind the Squirrel Nut Zippers&#x2019; most memorable songs, and the legendary Jimmie Rae Swagger.
	
	Do not be frightened when you see the musicians bringing out their saws &#x2014; Bright, a jazz crooner in her own right, is quite proficient on this implement, which when drawn with a bow produces music notes in the high pitch of a theremin; club owner Swingle, who used to front the band Trailer Bride, is also said to possess musical virtuosity on the saw.
	
	The show starts with Katharine Whalen&#x2019;s Swedish Patrol, followed by Jimmie Rae Swagger and the Fussy Eaters. The crunching rock band Codeine Haze will play too, with Crystal Bright and the Silver Hands headlining the evening&#x2019;s events. Admission is a suggested donation of $10.&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style='display: inline !important; float: none; background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: "open-sans",serif; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-justify: auto; text-transform: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;'&gt;For some heavy fun in a cryptlike club offset from the general madness of Halloween on Franklin Street, dive into the Cave.&lt;/span&gt;</body>

    <title>Chapel Hill Businesses Still Closed From September Flooding</title>
    <subhead></subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>CHAPEL HILL &#x2014; Businesses and residents in areas of Chapel Hill flooded out by rainfall from Hurricane Florence have not all returned, though the waters receded more than a month ago. 
	
	The flooding of two principal creeks near their crossings beneath East Franklin Street revealed that several busy parts of town remain vulnerable to stormwater and drainage problems long recognized by the Town of Chapel Hill. These flood zones are primarily clustered in the low-lying areas near Bolin Creek and Booker Creek, which threaten roads, residential areas and retail zones along the eastern approach to downtown Chapel Hill.
	
	Some businesses at Eastgate Crossing shopping plaza (which sits on a Booker Creek culvert) have reopened, while others are struggling to reopen, and some will never reopen. At least one former business there, the clothing retailer Chico&#x2019;s, has revealed that it will not reopen its store at the shopping plaza, though Chico&#x2019;s maintains another store at the Streets of Southpoint mall in Durham.
	
	Communities from the Piedmont to the Outer Banks continue to recover from the devastation to structures, lives and property left in the wake of Hurricane Florence, a toll the North Carolina Office of State Budget and Management has recently estimated at $17 billion.
	
	In Chapel Hill, Florence reaffirmed vulnerabilities to flooding after heavy, sustained rainfall in several busy parts of town. Severe post-storm flooding on September 17 challenged the commercial and residential infrastructure of Chapel Hill&#x2019;s and Carrboro&#x2019;s vulnerable floodplains. Water lapped at two major traffic corridors at Franklin Street and Fordham Boulevard, conduits for traffic to and from Durham and Interstate 40. Police shut down parts of the Fordham-Franklin interchange, where both roads merge into U.S. 15-501, as part of the September 17 flood response.
	
	The apartments and condominiums at Camelot Village on Estes Drive on the western edge of the lowlands between the creeks were devastated when Bolin Creek seeped into them (the University Place shopping mall, which is directly across Estes Drive from Camelot Village, was also shut down on September 17 when floodwaters inundated the parking lot). 
	
	Many residents of Camelot Village were forced to seek housing elsewhere, and some Camelot Village tenants had their leases terminated due to the extent of the flooding. The cleanup of damaged units continues.
	
	There was similar damage on June 30, 2013, when more than 60 units at Camelot Village were harmed when Bolin Creek surged after 5 inches of rain fell in less than 24 hours. That storm also caused significant flooding in nearby Carrboro and shut down activity at Eastgate Crossing (then called the Shops at Eastgate) when Booker Creek flooded the parking lot there.
	
	A few weeks earlier, the consulting firm Kimley-Horn had delivered a &#x201C;Flood Mitigation and Stormwater Infrastructure Improvements Feasibility Study&#x201D; for the Town of Chapel Hill, emphasizing the flood danger posed by Booker Creek.
	
	&#x201C;The Ephesus Church-Fordham area is significantly impacted by drainage inefficiencies and high water levels within Booker Creek, which currently passes directly under Eastgate Shopping Center&#x2026; The Ephesus Church-Fordham area represents the most urbanized sub-watershed along Booker Creek,&#x201D; the report said. 
	
	&#x201C;Redevelopment or sustained vitality of this commercial area is not only dependent upon transportation improvements but also upon the reduction of flood risk to the commercial tenants as well as the consumers they serve.&#x201D;
	
	This time around, business owners at Eastgate Crossing have put their professional lives on hold to deal with the fallout. The waters climbed to midway up the front-entrance doors of some of the commercial spaces.  
	
	The Great Outdoor Provision Co. suffered 9 inches of floodwater on its wooden showroom floor. Store manager Chad Pickens had spent the night inside the Eastgate location, as was detailed days later on the company&#x2019;s website. 
	
	&#x201C;Chad was dashing outside during the wind and rain to check the storm drain in front of the store and the spot where Booker Creek emerges from the shopping center out back,&#x201D; the site reads. Between 3 AM and 4 AM, he made the call to start &#x201C;a 14-hour evacuation.&#x201D;
	
	Pickens knew how to handle the situation partly due to knowledge gained from serving on the Chapel Hill Stormwater Management Utility Advisory Board. He and his staff struggled to clean up for a September 19 fire sale in which the remainder of their undamaged goods were sold to raise money, and for a partial reopening on September 21 as new merchandise began to arrive. An official grand reopening with fully stocked shelves took place on October 18. 
	
	 
	
	A few additional storefronts and eateries quickly bounced back, including national grocery chain Trader Joe&#x2019;s and local favorite Guglhupf Bakery and Patisserie. Others, like Bruegger&#x2019;s Bagels and Stein Mart, needed more extensive repairs. One of the more heavily trafficked businesses at Eastgate, Starbucks, had its interior gutted on September 20.
	
	Just down the street in Village Plaza, craft store Yarns Etc. was dealing with so much damage that owner Mary Stowe had to crowdsource the recovery, raising $6,500 the week after the storm. &#x201C;Thank you for your donations through Go Fund Me!&#x201D; Stowe wrote on the company Facebook page. &#x201C;I am humbled by your generosity.&#x201D; 
	
	Eastgate is located in what is now called the Blue Hill District of Chapel Hill. It has been known to flood as far back as 1958, when developers redirected Booker Creek using a culvert beneath the plaza&#x2019;s parking lot. As more commercial real estate was constructed in and around Blue Hill over the following 60 years, the once-porous landscape of wooded wetlands was replaced with tar, asphalt and concrete. The less soil available to absorb rainwater, the more likely a given area will be to see dangerous flood levels. 
	
	Floodplain regulations in the Blue Hill District were nonexistent before the mid-1970s, when the Federal Disaster Assistance Administration (which became the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA) and the National Flood Insurance Program established strict guidelines for developers.
	
	A particularly destructive flood in 2000 was blamed on the Eastgate culvert, leading to improvements in its design. The 2013 Kimley-Horn and Associates, Inc. stormwater study, however, found that reduction in water levels during flood events would be negligible, &#x201C;even with a culvert width three times as wide as the existing culvert.&#x201D; 
	
	The 2017 Lower Booker Creek Subwatershed study commissioned by the town concluded that, while the concrete culvert running below Fordham Boulevard would hold up through a 100-year flooding event, the Eastgate design could not. A 100-year flooding event is defined as achieving levels that have a 1 percent chance of happening any year, based on historical data.
	
	Chapel Hill officials and Federal Realty Investment Trust are currently teaming up on a $1 million project to increase the wetlands basin behind the shopping center as a possible help in floods. Federal Realty&#x2019;s on-site property manager for Eastgate told the Sundial they were unable to discuss any single store&#x2019;s renovation progress because to do so may violate leasing agreements.
	
	Tsehaye Lindsey-Mills, who works as a waitress at Babalu Tapas &amp;amp; Tacos, described the work of recovering after the September flooding in writing to the Sundial: &#x201C;We were hit pretty hard by the aftershock of hurricane Florence, but we are back in business! We had our line cooks &amp;amp; managers at the location almost everyday doing damage control. The water covered almost the entire patio and even went above the tables//chairs! Thankfully, we put our flood gates up, so there wasn't much internal damage."
	
	Recent reopenings include Bablalu Tapa&#x2019;s &amp;amp; Tacos and Birkenstock Feet First, but several stores, including Stein Mart, are still closed. </body>

    <title>NC Supreme Court Portraits to Be Trimmed of Bigots</title>
    <subhead></subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>RALEIGH &#x2014; Members of the North Carolina Supreme Court have ordered the establishment of an advisory commission to study the portraits of past justices currently displayed within its halls. The commission will survey the biographies and historical context of the individuals pictured, and then make recommendations for the possible removal of those with strong connections to racism. 
	
	The high court&#x2019;s order was precipitated by an op-ed article published in the News &amp;amp; Observer on Thursday, October 25. Both UNC-Chapel Hill law and ethics professor Eric L. Muller and former Chapel Hill councilwoman and current Orange County Board of Commissioners candidate Sally Greene penned the article, which questions the legacy of Thomas Ruffin, who served as North Carolina Supreme Court Chief Justice from 1833 to 1852. Ruffin was a slave owner whose rhetoric on race and civil rights were considered extreme, even for his time. 
	
	Ruffin&#x2019;s is particularly known for his written opinion in State v. Mann, a decision in 1829 in which the North Carolina Supreme Court overturned the assault conviction of John Mann. Mann had shot a slave named Lydia, whom he had bought for a year from her original owner, when she attempted escape him during a vicious bout of corporal punishment. The court&#x2019;s ruling established that slaves should have no legal protection from the authority of their owners, and said owners could not be found guilty of crimes against them. 
	
	&#x201C;The chilling message of State v. Mann was that, in the name of discipline, masters could wield virtually limitless force,&#x201D; wrote Muller and Greene. &#x201C;He went out of his way not just to inflict hardship on the enslaved people who happened to cross his path, but also to endow brutality with the force of law.
	
	&#x201C;How can Thomas Ruffin not trouble us in 2018?&#x201D; they asked.
	
	The commission is expected to make its recommendations by December 31, 2019, and will include public input as well as an examination of practices by high courts in other states and jurisdictions.  </body>

    <title>OWASA Issues Advisory to Boil and Conserve After Water System Malfunctions</title>
    <subhead></subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>CARRBORO &#x2014; The Orange Water and Sewer Authority (OWASA) was unable to deliver potable water to customers during the workday Monday, November 5, after a main line pipe burst at its treatment plant on Jones Ferry Road this morning, causing traffic jams and public facility closures. 
	
	The utility apologized to residents in Chapel Hill and Carrboro, and advised them to limit their water usage to help keep storage levels from decreasing at an even faster pace. 
	
	&#x201C;We are not yet at what we would consider to be emergency levels,&#x201D; said OWASA press officer Linda Low, &#x201C;but we are asking for all customers to conserve.&#x201D;
	
	Low was unable to provide the Sundial with an estimate of current water levels. OWASA was busy investigating what caused the break, she said.
	
	Low also recommended that local tap water be boiled prior to consumption. When levels are low, she said, &#x201C;our system loses pressure, and adequate pressure is what prevents [sewage] backflow,&#x201D; which could pose a host of health problems.
	
	The Carrboro Cybrary in the Century Center building also closed its doors visitors before 12 PM, although Recreation and Parks employees were still in their offices at the time. Jones Ferry Road between Bim Street and Barnes Street will remain closed until further notice. 
	
	Schools operating in the Chapel Hill&#x2013;Carrboro district dismissed their students early, with elementary grades letting out 11:30 AM, middle schools at noon, and high schools at 1 PM.
	
	The official Twitter account for the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill posted the following message at 10:58 AM: &#x201C;Classes are cancelled and all non-mandatory operations are suspended; only mandatory employees must report to or remain at work.&#x201D; 
	
	UNC&#x2019;s announcement continued, &#x201C;Non-faculty (staff) non-mandatory employees must not report, or must leave campus.&#x201D; 
	
	As of Monday evening, UNC&#x2019;s Twitter page has said that the school will be at AlertCarolina Condition 2, meaning that above measures are taken, and employees that are sent home must use leave time. 
	
	The AlertCarolina condition was initially scheduled until 11 AM Tuesday, November 6, and later was extended to remain active until 5 PM Tuesday.
	
	Campus dining services will be open at Lenoir Dining Hall from 11 AM to 8:30 PM and Chase Dining Hall from 9 AM to 8:30 PM Tuesday, November 6. All other retail locations on campus will be closed Tuesday, the school announced.
	
	&#x201C;When you see an OWASA crew member fixing or replacing a pipe, we know that it&#x2019;s inconvenient,&#x201D; Low said. 
	
	She thanked customers for their patience. &#x201C;Unfortunately, we can&#x2019;t anticipate all events, but we&#x2019;re working at it.&#x201D;   
	
	Many restaurant businesses on Franklin Street downtown had signs posted saying they were closed due to the water shortage Monday.
	
	OWASA troubles have cost the Chapel Hill-Carrboro economy recently. On the weekend of February 2, 2017, a fluoride overfeed caused a systemwide shutdown of the water main. Downtown merchants and the tourism industry lost expected sales estimated to total in the millions of dollars over the weekend, and residents were told not to do so much as flush their toilets, due to the utility&#x2019;s fears of backsiphonage reversing the water&#x2019;s flow and causing contamination.
	
	Periodic updates will be provided at OWASA&#x2019;s &lt;a href="https://www.owasa.org/" target="_blank"&gt;website &lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/OWASA1" target="_blank"&gt;Twitter page&lt;/a&gt;.  </body>

    <title>Sleepwalk to Murder? A &#x2018;Sleep Crimes&#x2019; Expert&#x2019;s Take on Phelps Conviction</title>
    <subhead></subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>RALEIGH &#x2014; Matthew Phelps of Raleigh pled guilty to first degree murder in October, and took a deal for life without parole as Wake County prosecutors waived their option to recommend the death penalty for killing his wife.
	
	Phelps had claimed, during a 911 call, to have killed his wife, Lauren, in a violent episode of sleepwalking, while under the influence of cold medicine. 
	
	Phelps said during the call, &#x201C;I have blood all over me and there's a bloody knife on the bed, and I think I did it.&#x201D;
	
	Lauren Hugelmaier Phelps&#x2019;s death was in some ways too distressingly common: a study of murdered women by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, made over more than a decade using data from 18 U.S. states, concluded that in more than 50 percent of the cases in which the perpetrator was identified, the woman&#x2019;s murderer was a current or former romantic partner.
	
	Attention focused on her husband&#x2019;s story of waking up from a dream covered in his wife&#x2019;s blood; Lauren Phelps, 29, was stabbed or slashed more than 120 times. 
	
	&#x201C;I had a dream,&#x201D; Phelps told the dispatcher during his emergency call on the morning of September 1, 2017, &#x201C;and then I turned on the lights, and she's dead on the floor.
	
	&#x201C;I took more medicine than I should have," Phelps told the 911 dispatcher.
	
	The dispatcher asked, &#x201C;What medicine did you take?&#x201D;
	
	&#x201C;I took Corocinin cough and cold,&#x201D; Phelps replied. &#x201C;Because I know it can make you feel good, so &#x2014; a lot of times I can&#x2019;t sleep at night.&#x201D; 
	
	On October 5, prosecutors told a Wake County Superior Court judge that lab results were positive for dextromethorphan, a common ingredient in cough and cold medicine, but that, although his levels exceeded that of a recommended dose, a chemist from the Raleigh/Wake City-County Bureau of Identification (CCBI) concluded that levels detected in Phelps did not &#x201C;rise to a toxic level, the kind of toxic level that would cause dizziness or hallucinations.&#x201D; 
	
	Although rare, the act of committing homicide while in a dream state is not without precedent. The phenomenon as recorded in America dates back to 1846, when Albert Tirrell successfully defended himself in Boston from the charge of killing his paramour Maria Bickford, by claiming he was asleep at the time his attack on her took place. 
	
	&#x201C;Unfortunately, from a legal perspective, homicidal somnambulism is very hard to prove or disprove,&#x201D; said Dr. David Brodner, an otolaryngologist (doctor of ear and throat ailments) and sleep expert who has delivered expert testimony to courtrooms; his Forensic Expert Witness Association profile lists sleep medicine among his areas of expertise. 
	
	&#x201C;I think overall as the society, sleep and sleep wellness and the importance of sleep on productivity is really coming on the forefront, and I think part of that is the legal profession having their eyes open to possible sleep-related defenses,&#x201D; Dr. Brodner said.
	
	&#x201C;There is actually a different disease [than somnambulism, or sleepwalking] called REM behavior disorder [RBD], when, for whatever reason, the person is not paralyzed and will act out their dreams,&#x201D; Brodner said. &#x201C;Usually someone has a history of sleepwalking, but it is possible for someone to sleepwalk only one time.  It would be a horrible coincidence if that one time is when they injure somebody.&#x201D;  
	
	According to general reference sources, court rulings around somnambulism have historically been inconsistent; some judges have forbidden the use of the sleepwalking as a defense, while others have considered it a viable defensive argument.
	
	 &#x201C;I think it&#x2019;s a viable defense, depending on the case,&#x201D; said Dr. Brodner, who practices in Boynton Beach, Fla. &#x201C;But blaming a medication&#x2026; It is possible, but overall it is very rare when compared to the number of people who take that medication safely.
	
	&#x201C;The bottom line is, it is going to have to be a defense of the last resort,&#x201D; Dr. Brodner said.
	
	As Phelps pleaded guilty and waived his right to a jury trial, the cough medicine was never employed as a defense in court; however, the 911 call was played before the judge at Phelps&#x2019;s plea hearing, and his lawyer introduced a troubled upbringing and substance abuse as mitigating factors to Phelps&#x2019;s crime.
	
	Prosecutors introduced some factors potentially damaging to Phelps&#x2019;s defense at the October 5 sentencing hearing, including that Phelps had described to a Raleigh detective a similar incident that occurred during his previous marriage, of dragging his first wife out of bed and down the hall in the middle of the night. 
	
	&#x201C;Evidence at the scene suggests that he made a coordinated effort to clean himself up before making that 911 call,&#x201D; Wake County prosecutor Kristen Fetter told Wake County Superior Court Judge Paul Ridgeway.
	
	Prosecutors also noted financial factors affecting Phelps&#x2019; relationship with his wife, and keyed in on his social media obsessions with certain movies in the serial-killer genre, including &#x201C;American Psycho&#x201D;, the 2000 film adaptation of Bret Easton Ellis&#x2019;s novel. 
	
	Some relatives of Lauren Phelps gave impact statements at his October 5 hearing describing how the crime has affected them, including her father, who said, &#x201C;How could he do this to us when we treated him like a son?&#x201D; 
	
	After having pleaded not guilty at a previous court appearance, Phelps agreed to a deal with Wake County prosecutors for a sentence of life without parole in lieu of the death penalty. His lawyer,  defense attorney Joe Cheshire, brought up substance abuse, including of cold medicine, and depression in the sentencing hearing as influences on Phelps.
	
	Phelps addressed the court and apologized for his actions. 
	
	 &#x201C;This was a senseless, mindless act and I regret every step that led me in that direction,&#x201D; Phelps said to the courtroom. He read from a statement he&#x2019;d prepared. &#x201C;I feel like a monster, one of the wretched, part of the darkness we don&#x2019;t speak of.
	
	&#x201C;That darkness consumed me until I was blind to the path I had taken&#x2026;that darkness causing me to do the unimaginable, to take a life that was not mine to take,&#x201D; Phelps read to his murdered wife&#x2019;s family. 
	
	Phelps continued: &#x201C;No length of time will ease my inner sorrow or relieve me of the memory of such a godless act as my hands, which I find incapable of doing, have committed, and I will have to live the rest of my life with these hands as a constant reminder.&#x201D;
	
	&#x201C;I am sorry that I took away Lauren&#x2019;s life, a life that was deeply connected to so many people: her family, her friends, her church, her coworkers, and especially her nephews,&#x201D; Phelps said. &#x201C;And though I am the very least of these, I took her away from myself.&#x201D;</body>

    <title>North Carolina Midterms Recap</title>
    <subhead></subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>NORTH CAROLINA &#x2014; The 2018 midterm elections saw Republican supermajorities in the North Carolina General Assembly broken, and changes to the state constitution approved by voter referendum. The North Carolina Supreme Court has a new justice,&#xD;
Anita Earls.
	
	Democrats in the North Carolina General Assembly needed to gain four &#xD;
seats in the state House of Representatives or six in the North Carolina&#xD;
 Senate to end the GOP&#x2019;s veto-proof majority. They ultimately succeeded &#xD;
flipping nine in the House and six in the Senate. Races in and around &#xD;
Raleigh, Charlotte and Greensboro all played decisive roles. 
	
	The Republican and Democratic parties each held onto their seats in North Carolina&#x2019;s 13 U.S. congressional districts &#x2014; Democrats won reelection in three districts, and Republicans held onto control in ten districts where they already held seats. &lt;br&gt;
	
	In two close United States House of Representatives contests, Republicans George Holding and Ted Budd held on to their seats in Congressional Districts 2 and 13 respectively. In the one of the state&#x2019;s tightest races, On Tuesday, Democratic candidate Dan McCready conceded a close election &#xD;
in North Carolina&#x2019;s House District 9 to Mark Harris, who had beaten &#xD;
incumbent Robert Pittenger in the Republican primary.&amp;nbsp;
	
	Speculation by academics and media as to why a projected Democratic &#x201C;blue wave&#x201D; didn&#x2019;t wash through North Carolina the way it did in some other states has focused on the gerrymandering question. The U.S. Supreme Court issued a redistricting order to the state that was not resolved prior to voting, leaving the illegal districts, found to have been drawn in such a way as to segment districts by racial demographics, intact.
	
	The Democrat-affiliated candidate for the North Carolina Supreme Court, Anita Earls, unseated her Republican-affiliated opponent Barbara Jackson, and defeated Republican-affiliated Christopher Anglin. State Republicans suspected Anglin, who was registered as Democrat till June, of running as Republican to split the vote, but did not succeed in erasing his listed affiliation from the ballot. Earls, who helped found the Southern Coalition for Social Justice, was a key player in the federal lawsuit brought against the state for racial gerrymandering. She took the seat with a plurality 49.3 percent of the vote. 
	
	Four of the six proposed constitutional amendments on the ballot this year were passed by voter referendum, with voters rejecting both the transfer of Judicial and Election Board appointment power from the Governor&#x2019;s office to the General Assembly and the reimagining of the Bipartisan State Board of Elections and Ethics Enforcement. The right to hunt, fish and harvest wildlife, Marsy&#x2019;s Law, the state income tax cap and a voter photo ID requirement are now enshrined in North Carolina&#x2019;s constitution.
	
	  
	
	ORANGE COUNTY RESULTS
	
	Voters in Orange County&#x2019;s 4th United States Congressional District reelected Democratic incumbent David Price to the House, whose defeat over Republican Steven Von Loor and Libertarian Party candidate Barbara Howe, ensures him a 16th term.
	
	State Senator Valerie Foushee won her reelection for a third term in District 23, which includes both Orange and Chatham counties. Republican candidate and former Marine Tom Glendinning lost to Foushee, capturing only 28.82 percent of the vote.
	
	The North Carolina House of Representatives had two seats up for grabs in Orange County; both Democrats currently serving in them beat their opponents handily, each with over 85 percent of the vote. In District 50, Graig Meyer was reelected over Hillsborough attorney Kenneth Rothrock. And in the race for District 56, voters gave Verla Insko a 12th term, deciding against Republican Marcus Cooke and Libertarian Matthew Clements.
	
	The following six county offices were all won by Democrats in races with no opposition candidates: Charles Blackwood as sheriff, Mark Kleinschmidt to the position Clerk of Superior Court, Sally Greene to the Board of Commissioners at-large, Jamezetta Bedford to the Board of Commissioners District 1, Earl McKee to the Board of Commissioners for District 2 and Mark Chilton to the position Register of Deeds.     
	
	The district attorney for District 18 winner, James Woodall, and NC District Court Judge for District 15B winner, Joseph Buckner, also ran unopposed. Both are members of Democratic party.
	
	In the nonpartisan race for Soil and Water Conservation District Supervisor, incumbent Chris Hogan and Heather Main defeated incumbent Morris Shambley for the two available seats.</body>

    <title>UNC Governors Have Till December to Mull Toppled Statue's Future</title>
    <subhead>"Silent Sam," pulled down by protestors on August 20, has uncertain future</subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>CHAPEL HILL &#x2014; The University of North Carolina Board of Governors granted a deadline extension to UNC-Chapel Hill officials tasked with deciding the future placement of Silent Sam, the Civil War monument of a Confederate infantryman toppled August 20 by campus protestors.
	
	Board of Governors Chairman Harry Smith announced at the governors&#x2019; meeting Friday, November 9 that Chapel Hill campus trustees requested more time to generate a reasonable solution to the polarizing problem of what to do with the toppled statue, which is now being stored. Officials were originally supposed to submit their proposal to board members by November 15, but Smith gave those involved until the next Board of Governors meeting on December 14 to figure out a realistic location for the statue.
	
	&#x201C;It&#x2019;s a lot more complex than I think any of us thought,&#x201D; said Smith.  &#x201C;You have to figure out a detailed, thorough plan, which is what we&#x2019;ve asked them for, that encompasses key and critical constituents from all views and perspectives.&#x201D;
	
	Shortly after the monument was toppled by student and community protestors in August, Smith and his colleagues gave Chancellor Carol Folt and the Board of Trustees the responsibility of devising a way forward that could satisfy a substantial portion of the student, faculty and alumni populations.  
	
	In addition to those competing interests, Folt must take a state historic preservation law into account.  The state law, passed in 2015, explicitly prohibits the removal of &#x201C;objects of remembrance,&#x201D; directing their return to a site of &#x201C;similar prominence&#x201D; within 90 days of its dislocation.
	
	 
	
	In October the UNC-Chapel Hill Faculty Council publicly called for Silent Sam&#x2019;s permanent expulsion from the campus.  The Council produced a 91-page document filled with suggestions, the result of a series of meetings where professors were invited to offer their personal opinions.  Transporting the monument to a Civil War battlefield or memorial site, donating it to a public or private museum, and selling it at an antiquities auction such as those run by Sotheby&#x2019;s or Christie&#x2019;s were all options listed in the report.
	
	The statue, known as &#x201C;Silent Sam&#x201D; for the soldier&#x2019;s lack of an ammo box, is currently being held at an undisclosed storage facility. The pedestal bearing dedication plaques still stands at McCorkle Place on North Campus.</body>

    <title>Whiteville Inmate Dies From Stabbing</title>
    <subhead></subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>WHITEVILLE &#x2014; Gregory Adams Jr., a prisoner serving time for attempted murder at Columbus Correctional Institution in Whiteville, North Carolina has died from injuries sustained from being stabbed multiple times on the morning of Friday, November 9.
	
	The assault took place at 7:55 AM, and left Adams in critical condition, with a devastating laceration in his neck. According to a statement released by the NC Department of Public Safety (DPS), Adams was subsequently transported to a nearby hospital, where the staff unsuccessfully attempted resuscitation. He was pronounced dead at 8:40 AM. 
	
	&#x201C;The Columbus Sheriff&#x2019;s Department and the SBI are investigating the incident,&#x201D; the press release read. &#x201C;DPS is cooperating with law enforcement and will seek criminal prosecution against any inmate involved in the death.&#x201D; The statement disclosed neither the exact type of weapon used, nor the name of the alleged perpetrator.
	
	In 2015, Adams was found guilty of attempted first-degree murder in connection with the shooting death of of Ra&#x2019;Quan Daniels in August of 2012. The 15-year-old Daniels, who lived near Adams in the Rankin Terrace public housing community in Wilmington, was shot five times in the back, which left him permanently paralyzed. Neighbors witnessed Daniels in conversation with Adams just prior to the teen&#x2019;s death. Wilmington Police testified that Adams was under the influence of the powerful dissociative street drug phencyclidine (PCP), sometimes known as &#x201C;angel dust.&#x201D; The judge sentenced him to 20 to 26 years of incarceration; he was scheduled for release in 2032.
	
	The Columbus medium-security facility is understaffed by 14 percent, according to data recently provided by DPS. Vacancies in key positions often increase the rate of violent behavior by prisoners who take advantage of gaps in security. Earlier this year, a riot at Lee Correctional Facility in South Carolina that left seven inmates dead was attributed in part to a chronic shortage of employees as well as an exhausting overtime schedule.

    <title>Calling Himself U.S. Marshal Lands Man in Federal Court</title>
    <subhead></subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>KERNERSVILLE &#x2014; A federal grand jury returned an indictment for a Kernersville resident on charges of impersonating a United States Marshal by carrying phony credentials, tactical gear, and multiple firearms, leading to his arrest by federal agents three days later.
	
	In late September, the U.S. Marshals Middle District office received information that a middle-aged white male told Duplin County Sheriff&#x2019;s deputies that he worked for the Marshals Service, and was stationed at their Greensboro office. It is unclear what initially aroused the deputies&#x2019; suspicion, but they reported the encounter and an investigation was opened.
	
	U.S. Marshals arrested the man at his home on November 2.&lt;br&gt;
	
	On November 8, a federal District Court judge set a bond of $10,000 with the understanding that the alleged impersonator&amp;nbsp;is not to leave the area and must honor a curfew. He is also forbidden to own ammunition until his case is resolved.
	
	The alleged impersonator walked into the Winston-Salem Police Department on October 14 to request assistance in locating a fugitive, according to the Greensboro News &amp;amp; Record. The man was wearing a bullet-proof vest and sporting a forged Marshal badge and sidearm that initially appeared authentic to law enforcement. He was also travelling with an AR-15 assault rifle in the trunk of his white Ford Mustang. 
	
	After meeting with the alleged impostor, officers arrested the man and seized a number of items, including a Glock Model 17 Gen 4 9mm semi-automatic pistol, ammunition, a loaded AR-15 .223-caliber magazine, and a law enforcement utility belt with holster and a pair of handcuffs. He was released pending investigation.
	
	U.S. Marshal Jason Morton later discovered that the man had been presenting himself as federal officer to ProShots, a local gun dealer and shooting range, as far back as 2012, and was even given a discounted law enforcement rate.

    <title>Deceased Candidate Wins School Board Seat &#x2013; Now What?</title>
    <subhead></subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>WAKE COUNTY &#x2014; Kathy Hartenstine, incumbent member of the Wake County Board of Education, filed as a candidate for election to  her seat on the board, and her name appeared on the November midterm ballots as the only candidate in that race. She is projected to win &#x2014; election results being certified today, Friday, November 16 &#x2014; but that means  election officers and Wake County Public Schools officials now have a problem, because Hartenstine passed away unexpectedly on September 23.&lt;p&gt;
	
	Hartenstine, a lifelong educator who was appointed to her school board seat in January 2017, is expected to have clinched 95 percent of votes cast in the race for the District 7 school board seat, according to preliminary election results published by the State Board of Ethics and Elections Enforcement.
	
	What happens next is unclear to election officials, school board attorneys and the public, leaving uncertain who will serve on the board that governs the largest public school district in North Carolina, with an average enrollment of 160,429 students during the 2017-2018 school year.
	
	As Hartenstine&#x2019;s death was only 43 days prior to the election, rules determined that a ballot with her name removed could not be approved and reprinted in time. 
	
	The State Board of Elections might fill the seat by counting the 1,446 write-in ballots, constituting about 5 percent of the total vote. But giving the job to a candidate representing a very small fraction of county residents who voted has some worried about an under-qualified school board member. 
	
	The State Board of Elections might fill the seat with a runner-up by counting up the 1,446 write-in ballots, about 5 percent of the total vote. But giving the job to a candidate representing a fraction of county residents has some civil servants, and students&#x2019; parents, worried. 
	
	There is no official list of write-in candidates for North Carolina elections. It is unclear if the board is even required to publish a comprehensive list of every write-in.
	
	One active candidate was Karl Rectanus, who threw his hat into the ring only after Hartenstine died. According to an open letter he gave to media, Rectanus&#x2019; main motivation was as a lesson in democratic values for his daughter, but he had &#x201C;no expectations of winning or filling the seat.&#x201D; 
	
	His run, he believed, would bring &#x201C;attention to down-ballot offices to encourage citizens to come out and vote.&#x201D; 
	
	While the final write-in tally hasn&#x2019;t been announced, Rectanus made it clear that he is not the right person for the job, writing, &#x201C;I support the Wake County Board of Education to choose a candidate and fill Kathy Hartenstine&#x2019;s seat as they see fit.&#x201D; He added that if Wake County proceeds with the write-in option and he wins, &#x201C;I will immediately resign from the role.&#x2019;&#x2019;
	
	School board leaders supported this option of appointment rather than run-up victory as well. After a work session on November 7, they opened &lt;a id="Temp" href="https://simbli.eboardsolutions.com/Meetings/Attachment.aspx?S=920&amp;amp;AID=149242&amp;amp;MID=4822" target="_blank"&gt;a process for application&lt;/a&gt;. County Commissioner Greg Ford said that residents who voted for Hartenstine did so believing the Board would step in to appoint someone with experience and expertise.
	
	Ford took to Twitter on Tuesday, November 13 with praise for Rectanus and his letter, thanking him for &#x201C;leading on this, and for reinforcing public faith and trust in fair and transparent elections.&#x201D; 
	
	Two state laws conflict on this topic. North Carolina Statute 115C-37, which went into effect in 1981 and specifically covers the elections of school board members, says deceased candidates &#x201C;shall not be considered and the candidates receiving the highest number of votes equal to the number of positions to be filled shall be elected.&#x201D; 
	
	Statute 163A-1622, passed in 1971 to ostensibly cover all elections in North Carolina , states that if a dead person wins an election, &#x201C;the board...shall declare the office vacant and it shall be filled in the manner provided by law.&#x201D; Former general counsel to the General Assembly Gerry Cohen told the News &amp;amp; Observer this will allow the Board of Education to fill the seat as it sees fit. The state law that created the Wake County school board election district specifically cites 163A, not 115C. </body>

    <title>Feds Prioritize Teen&#x2019;s Nov. 5 Kidnapping in Lumberton</title>
    <subhead>Hania Noelia Aguilar, 13, is about 5 feet tall, weighs 126 pounds, and has brown eyes and black hair</subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>&#xD;
		&#xD;
			LUMBERTON &#x2014; The case of the Lumberton teen abducted from her front yard on November 5 is currently dubbed the FBI&#x2019;s &lt;a href="https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/kidnap/hania-noelia-agiular" target="_blank"&gt;&#x201C;Case of the Week.&#x201D;&lt;/a&gt; Agents believe that that a tip from the public prompted by raised awareness might lead investigators to her whereabouts. 
	
	Hania Noelia Aguilar, 13, was outside her residence in the Rosewood Mobile Home Park on Elizabeth Road awaiting a ride to school outside her home when an unknown male forcibly threw her into a running green 2003 Ford Expedition, identified by the FBI as a relative&#x2019;s vehicle. The vehicle was discovered by authorities, with the public&#x2019;s help three days later and approximately eight miles from the crime scene. 
	
	&#x201C;Witnesses heard her scream,&#x201D; Shelley Lynch, a public affairs specialist with FBI Charlotte, announced in a statement. Neighbors reportedly then &#x201C;saw a man dressed in all black wearing a yellow bandana force her into her family&#x2019;s SUV and drive away.&#x201D;
	
	Aguilar&#x2019;s relative who saw the attack rushed to a nearby home to ask for help. The neighbor then dialed 911 dispatch, which recorded the call at 6:54 AM. 
	
	Shortly thereafter, surveillance footage was released by the FBI that seemed to capture a man fitting that description near the trailer park only hours prior to the incident. Despite the video&#x2019;s poor resolution, officials ask for assistance in identifying the subject.
	
	On Tuesday, November 13, Governor Roy Cooper pledged $5,000 from the state to add to the Bureau&#x2019;s reward of $25,000 reward to any person with information steering law enforcement toward Aguilar&#x2019;s location, or leading to the suspect&#x2019;s capture and arrest. 
	
	According to the AMBER Alert issued after her kidnapping, the adolescent Aguilar is about 5 feet tall, weighs 126 pounds, and has brown eyes and black hair. At the time of her disappearance she was believed to be wearing blue jeans and a blue shirt with a flower print. See the site linked at the top of the article for photos.
	
	Anyone with pertinent knowledge is urged to call the tip line at 910-272-5871 or reach out to Lumberton Police at 910-671-3845.&#xD;

    <title>Mooresville Teacher Reported Killed in Mexico</title>
    <subhead></subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>MOORESVILLE &#x2014; Friends and family of the Triangle middle school teacher who went missing while on vacation in Mexico had their worst fears confirmed this past Wednesday, November 14. According to authorities in the district of Chihuahua, Patrick Braxton-Andrew, 34, became a casualty of the country&#x2019;s violent drug wars . 
	
	Braxton-Andrew&#x2019;s father, Gary Andrew, received news of his son's death from Chihuahua&#x2019;s governor, Javier Corral, who personally called the family to offer his condolences. 
	
	Braxton-Andrew was last seen alive on October 28 exiting his hotel in the small town of Urique, located near Copper Canyon, a popular tourist destination. He was a veteran backpacker, and had visited Latin America on multiple occasions as the Assistant Resident Director of the Davidson College study abroad program in Peru, a position he took up in 2011.
	
	Investigators had few leads to go on when they launched their manhunt. The Mooresville community held out hope that he was simply stranded or lost in the surrounding wilderness and would return home alive. As of November 20, the Associated Press has updated its reporting on the disappearance of Braxton-Andrew, quoting Governor Corral that his body was discovered after a search of the Copper Canyon area, a vast reach of mountainous terrain cut through with river canyons. 
	
	On Corral&#x2019;s official Facebook page on late November 15 (local time), he wrote an &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/javiercorralj/posts/2535820199768990" target="_blank"&gt;announcement &lt;/a&gt; about the case. His statement, translated, reads, &#x201C;The Attorney General&#x2019;s Office has obtained information that Patrick Braxton-Andrew&#x2026;was murdered on Sunday, October 28&#x2026;at the hands of the narco-trafficker Jos&#xE9; Noriel Portilo Gil, alias El Chueco.&#x201D;
	
	Governor Corral promised justice for Patrick, claiming the homicide is tied directly to drug kingpin Jos&#xE9; Noriel Portilo Gil. Intelligence agents in the United State and Mexico have kept tabs on El Chueco as he climbed the ranks of the Sinaloa Cartel, a ruthless gang once headed by Joaqu&#xED;n &#x201C;El Chapo&#x201D; Guzman, currently on trial in Brooklyn.
	
	Corral&#x2019;s post continued, &#x201C;When you attack innocent people, who have nothing to do with criminal groups, or disputes between criminal gangs, those cases of good people, should be seen as a priority and they should never go unpunished.&#x201D;
	
	A spokesperson of the U.S. State Department told the Sundial, &#x201C;We are aware of the social media post reporting the death of a U.S. citizen in Mexico. We are providing all appropriate consular services. Due to privacy considerations, we have no further comment.&#x201D;
	
	A family member of Braxton-Andrew also put an announcement out over Facebook, in the Facebook group page set up to aid his search. &#x201C;It is with great sadness that we announce that Patrick died...at the hands of a criminal organization that operates in the area where he was traveling,&#x201D; the family wrote. &#x201C;Patrick died doing what he loved &#x2014; traveling and meeting people... Join us in celebrating his life as he would want us to do. We will always remember Patrick and his joy for life.&#x201D; 
	
	In 2018, the U.S. State Department issued an advisory to American tourists and expatriates in Mexico, cautioning them to avoid certain parts of the country. Chihuahua was listed as one of 11 states to which globetrotters should &#x201C;reconsider&#x201D; their travels, the State Department&#x2019;s advisory said. According to an analysis of the raw crime data conducted by Forbes Magazine, in 2016 &#x201C;more Americans were reported killed by homicide in Mexico than the combined total of Americans killed by homicide in every other country abroad.&#x201D; 
	
	Students and colleagues remember Braxton-Andrew as an adventurous traveler who often trekked out on his own to mingle with the local population and practice his Spanish. He later opened his own tutoring business and began teaching Spanish and algebra at the private Woodlawn School in Mooresville. </body>

    <title>False Call About Shooter Scares Carrboro Elementary</title>
    <subhead></subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>CARRBORO &#x2014; Police converged on Carrboro Elementary School on the morning of Tuesday, November 20, approximately two minutes after 911 dispatch received a call at 11:09 AM that is now being investigated as a hoax. It was seemingly delivered by a frightened young female who described a &#x201C;shooter walking around the school.&#x201D; The police department released an &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CarrboroPD/status/1065284862633041921" target="_blank"&gt;update&lt;/a&gt; on November 21 in which they state the call &#x201C;was placed by a juvenile who is a student at the school.&#x201D; It reads, &#x201C;The investigation is continuing to determine if charges are appropriate.&#x201D;
	
	Officers representing multiple agencies swept the hallways and secured the building room by room, but found nothing to confirm the caller&#x2019;s report &#x2014; nothing at the school appeared out of the ordinary.&amp;nbsp;
	
	Frightened parents, having been alerted by texts from the school system, news organizations on Twitter, personal contacts and other sources,&amp;nbsp;gathered at&amp;nbsp; Carrboro Town Commons several hundred yards from Carrboro Elementary. They were reassured by Police Chief Walter Horton and school administrators that no one was harmed.
	
	As the situation resolved on November 20, Captain Chris Atack of the Carrboro Police Department said, &#x201C;All information that we have at this point leads us to believe that it was not a legitimate call&#x2026; We have no injuries at the school, we have no incident at the school. All the children, all the staff and all the first responders are fine.&#x201D;
	
	The Chapel Hill&#x2013;Carrboro City Schools "active shooter protocol," first adopted in 2001, was implemented and both the elementary school and nearby Carrboro United Methodist Church and Child Care Center were locked down as required. The Carrboro Police Department, Chapel Hill Police Department, Orange County Sheriff&#x2019;s Office and NC State Bureau of Investigation (SBI) all had law enforcement officers present, accompanied by firefighters and first responders.
	
	A Triangle law enforcement officer close to the Sundial who asked to remain anonymous said that the tactical response &#x201C;appeared to run as it should have.&#x201D;
	
	&#x201C;Officers flooded the scene, emergency resources were staged...parents were told to stay away from school and it appears most did as they were told,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;All in all, it probably couldn't have run a lot smoother.&#x201D;
	
	When asked why this school system does not assign a school resource officer (SRO) to each elementary school the way it does at middle and high schools, the same contact replied that it is &#x201C;cost prohibitive.&#x201D;
	
	Once it was clear that their children were not in danger, parents were allowed to pick their children up early or let them remain in class for the rest of the school day. 
	
	Some students were then bussed to the Commons, by Town Hall, and reunited with relieved family. </body>

	Until the morning after Thanksgiving, when Oliver-Bruno answered a request made by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) for fingerprinting related to his legal battle by presenting himself at a USCIS office in Morrisville on Friday, November 23, accompanied by supporters &#x2014; only to be arrested by plainclothes agents of with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).
	
	He, his son, Daniel Oliver-Perez, and his legal team entered the building. Shortly thereafter, activists and religious leaders waiting outside saw through the window a brief struggle as ICE agents took hold of Oliver-Bruno. ICE managed to restrain Oliver-Bruno, lead him out a back door, and place him in a van. 
	
	A crowd of people then blocked the ICE agents&#x2019; van from leaving with Oliver-Bruno in custody. 
	
	At 9:15 AM the Morrisville Police Department responded to the location after a 911 caller described the crowd. The van was blocked for more than two hours by his supporters, many of whom were singing and praying. Morrisville officers and Wake County Sheriff&#x2019;s deputies proceeded to arrest 27 individuals for preventing ICE from taking action on a valid federal warrant. 
	
	According to a press release from immigration hotline Alerta Migratoria NC, Oliver-Bruno was called into USCIS offices ostensibly to continue the process of deferring his deportation. 
	
	According to ICE spokesperson Bryan Cox, Bruno-Oliver was arrested &#x201C;during a targeted enforcement action.&#x201D; 
	
	&#x201C;Mr. Oliver-Bruno is a convicted criminal who has received all appropriate legal process under federal law, has no outstanding appeals, and has no legal basis to remain in the U.S.,&#x201D; Cox wrote over email.
	
	Oliver-Bruno&#x2019;s convictions are for in-state traffic violations and reentry charges such as falsifying documents. An ICE spokesman said that Oliver-Bruno was conviced in 2014 on charges of illegally crossing the U.S. border and providing fraudulent papers to U.S. authorities, a felony conviction which Oliver-Bruno appealed unsuccessfully.
	
	After arresting Oliver-Bruno in the USCIS offices on Friday, ICE agents arrested his son Oliver-Perez, a U.S. citizen, in the parking lot. 
	
	Daniel Oliver-Perez was arrested for &#x201C;physically assaulting a federal law enforcement officer in performance of their official duties,&#x201D; Cox said.
	
	Oliver-Perez was bonded out of Wake County jail but faces state assault charges. He could potentially face federal charges as well, if the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of North Carolina chooses to pursue that option.
	
	Oliver-Perez relies on his father&#x2019;s support for his college studies, and Julia Perez-Pacheco, Oliver-Bruno&#x2019;s wife, has been undergoing medical treatment for Lupus with her husband&#x2019;s financial help as well.  
	
	Oliver-Bruno was initially arrested at the U.S.-Mexico border in 2014, when he was charged with possession of fraudulent documents for reentry. He was allowed to enter the country on parole while awaiting adjudication.
	
	U.S. congressmen David Price and G. K. Butterfield issued a joint statement that was critical of ICE and USCIS conduct in Morrisville on Friday. &#x201C;At best, Mr. Oliver-Bruno was presented with a catch-22 dilemma; at worst, he was entrapped,&#x201D; they said. 
	
	&#x201C;It&#x2019;s clear that while Mr. Oliver-Bruno was attempting to follow the law in pursuit of his legal petition, ICE coordinated with USCIS to target him upon his leaving the City Well United Methodist Church.&#x201D;
	
	Whether or not Oliver-Bruno and his lawyers will attempt an entrapment defense remains to be seen, but it will be a difficult argument to make. The 1988 US Supreme Court decision Matthews v. United States laid out the requirements for proving entrapment in a federal court. Then&#x2013;Chief Justice William Rehnquist wrote that a valid entrapment defense has &#x201C;two related elements: government inducement of the crime, and a lack of predisposition on the part of the defendant to engage in the criminal conduct.&#x201D; Since Oliver-Bruno&#x2019;s actual charges involve passing off fake identity documents as legitimate of his own accord as well as traffic violations, whether he was arrested through government duplicity may be immaterial.
	
	Oliver-Bruno was one of six immigrants in North Carolina residing on church properties for sanctuary from deportation. An Obama-era internal ICE policy prohibits agents from making arrests at schools, churches and hospitals, barring pressing circumstances. However, Cox said that &#x201C;unlawfully present foreign nationals are subject to arrest and removal regardless of how long they remain within a designated sensitive location.&#x201D; 
	
	ICE officials have agreed to keep Oliver-Bruno in the United States while his case makes its way through the immigration courts, most likely in a regional detention center in Georgia. 
	
	The Sundial reached out to USCIS for comment but have received no reply as of publication. </body>

    <title>Library Greenlit for Downtown Carrboro</title>
    <subhead></subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>CARRBORO &#x2014; Given that its neighbor Chapel Hill has maintained a public library since 1958 (relocated at least once, and reconstructed in 2013) Carrboro&#x2019;s Recreation and Parks department is making moves to indicate the smaller town is due for a library of its own.  
	
	The department and the Orange County Library system plan to build one collaboratively, over what is now a free public parking lot on South Greensboro Street between Robeson and Carr streets. 
	
	The capital investment plan estimates the construction of the library building to cost $5,625,000, and equipment and furnishings to cost $750,000.
	
	The town currently has the Cybrary, a one-room computer lab with a few shelves of newly published books, located in the Century Center on Greensboro Street. It&#x2019;s a quiet place to sit and read a newspaper or browse the internet, but limited in resources.
	
	There is also a branch library at Carrboro at McDougle Middle School, where the annual Carrboro Book Sale is held. 
	
	In Chapel Hill, there are the well-stocked and technologically advanced Chapel Hill Public Library (not part of the county system), and a half dozen cavernous University of North Carolina libraries and special collections that non-students can make use of for an annual $25 fee.
	
	But Carrboro wants its own space for the Orange County Southern Branch Library. That space will occupy a vacant gravel lot just down the street from The Cybrary at 203 South Greensboro, which is currently used as a parking lot across from the Open Eye Caf&#xE9;. In 2016, the Carrboro Board of Aldermen commissioned a capital feasibility study for the hope of developing a multi-use community space that would include a new library. Following positive results, Carrboro and Orange County teamed up with the ArtsCenter and community radio station WCOM what was dubbed the 203 Project. Those organizations will also share the space with the Carrboro Recreation and Parks Department.
	
	 &#x201C;We are estimating that Personnel Services and Operations [for the new library] combined will cost approximately $622,000 [annually],&#x201D; said Orange County library system assistant director Andrea Tullos. &#x201C;We will have 10 FTEs [full-time employees] that will support this facility, but we are also taking FTEs from the other branches. So there will be seven new [positions] open.&#x201D;
	
	Trish McGuire, 203 Project planning director, said funding will be a shared responsibility of each occupant organization. &#x201C;There are some costs that are going to be distributed in three ways, based on the three principal participants.  And then other costs are going to be allocated by square footage. It's not exactly going to be a perfect line because even though we will each have our own spaces there will be some building systems we share, like lights and security; and those will be distributed proportionally.&#x201D; And maintenance after construction &#x201C;will probably be the same framework.&#x201D;
	
	However, not everything is nailed down yet. Exact cost distribution &#x201C;all depends on the final design,&#x201D; said McGuire.
	
	It wasn&#x2019;t until early September of this year that architects first presented three sketches of potential designs for the complex to town officials and the public. Pitched by the firm Perkins+Will Global, &#x201C;The Plaza,&#x201D; &#x201C;The Commons&#x201D; and &#x201C;The Float&#x201D; designs were each given equal consideration, and all three attempted to meet the demands of the stakeholders.
	
	After three public input meetings, &#x201C;The Plaza&#x201D; (entirely ground floor) and &#x201C;The Float&#x201D; (with an open lobby) lost favor to &#x201C;The Commons&#x201D;. This design satisfies each stakeholder organization &#x2014; the OC library system, ArtsCenter (a private nonprofit), WCOM radio and Carrboro Recreation and Parks Department &#x2014; and had positive public feedback. It lays out a three-story building with a total of 45,000 square feet of floor space. The $21 million construction cost will be shared proportionally by the occupants. The exact dollar amount owed by each stakeholder will be determined at a later date.    
	
	This design alone did not place the library on the ground floor, but instead on the second, to the disappointment of  some representatives for OC Library system, as they anticipate high level of pedestrian traffic. That placement is likely assured, though, because even before the design process was begun county library administrators and Carrboro Recreation and Parks Department had agreed early on not to split the library between two floors         
	
	&#x201C;&#x2018;The Commons design was the most synergistic and the most favorably evaluated by community input,&#x201D; Board of Alderman member Randee Haven-O&#x2019;Donnell told the Sundial. 
	
	&#x201C;Right now, we&#x2019;re really moving into the more substantive portion of the design phase...because a design has to be vetted through a process,&#x201D; she continued. &#x201C;I think what has to happen now is we have to get input from the partners on the specifics of what they&#x2019;re looking for.&#x201D; 
	
	October 1 marked the beginning of a 45-day due diligence period, allowing each stakeholder time to make a final commitment to the project. But even if no organization backs out, Haven-O&#x2019;Donnell said, &#x201C;construction might not begin until 2020.&#x201D;  
	
	If one or more of the organizations does decide to end its role in the project, the development agreement stipulates that they &#x201C;may terminate [the] agreement by providing ten (10) days advance written notice to the other party of its intention.&#x201D; Otherwise, after the end of 45 days on November 14, additional input from the public will be solicited and the design finalized.  Only then will a building contractor be hired to break ground.     </body>

    <title>Body of Missing Teen Located, Perpetrator Still at Large</title>
    <subhead></subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>LUMBERTON &#x2014; The remains of Hania Aguilar, the 13-year-old girl &lt;a href="https://piedmontsundial.com/calendar/calendar_main_article.php?theArticle=207" target="_blank"&gt;abducted&lt;/a&gt; from Rosewood Mobile Home Park three weeks ago, have been located by Lumberton Police, according to Chief Michael McNeill, who broke the news during a brief press conference on Wednesday, November 28.
	
	A licensed forensic odontologist will be required to verify the victim&#x2019;s identity through the evaluation of dental records, but authorities believe the body has been correctly identified as Aguilar.
	
	Investigators are reluctant to discuss the details of an open investigation, and Lumberton PD refused to elaborate on the condition in which the cadaver was found, saying only that she was recovered from a body of water within a 10-mile radius of the site of her kidnapping. 
	
	The manner of death also remains undisclosed as of publication. 
	
	&#x201C;This is the outcome that we all feared,&#x201D; McNeill told reporters. &#x201C;We wanted to bring Hania back home and bring her back home alive to our community. It hurts.&#x201D; 
	
	Aguilar was forced into an idling green SUV in the early morning of November 5, while waiting for a ride to school. 
	
	The vehicle in question is registered to Aguilar&#x2019;s aunt, and was discovered abandoned only a few miles south of the teen&#x2019;s home. A neighbor who witnessed the incident told detectives an adult male dressed in all black, except for a yellow bandana, physically overpowered the struggling adolescent and drove off before 911 was called. 
	
	The FBI joined the search early on, disseminating a photo of Aguilar nationwide and offering an additional $15,000, then $25,000 &#x2014; complemented by Governor Roy Cooper&#x2019;s $5,000 &#x2014; reward for information relevant to the multi-agency manhunt.   
	
	McNeill promised that he and his colleagues would work tirelessly in pursuit of the young girl&#x2019;s murderer.
	
	&#x201C;I wish we had a different outcome for Hania's family,&#x201D; McNeill said, adding that he is determined to seek closure &#x201C;for the community, and for the hundreds of law enforcement officers and searchers who put everything they had into finding her alive.&#x201D;
	
	Individuals who possess any information useful to law enforcement are encouraged to call the FBI at (910) 272-5871, or the Lumberton Police at (910) 671-3846. </body>

    <title>Agreement Would Let Company Pay $12 Million for GenX Water Contamination</title>
    <subhead>Chemours Produces Harmful Chemical Found Downstream from Eastern NC Plant</subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>BLADEN COUNTY  &#x2014; Chemours will pay North Carolina $12 million but will not admit culpability over the possible contamination of the chemical GenX in private wells and waterways, according to the terms of a proposed agreement with the state that has yet to be set in stone.
	
	The &lt;a href="https://files.nc.gov/ncdeq/GenX/Consent-order-11212018.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;agreement,&lt;/a&gt; which was initiated on November 21 but has yet to be finalized and approved, would also include an extra $1 million to cover the cost of DEQ&#x2019;s investigation.
	
	The proposed consent order  was jointly developed by officials with the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ), the Cape Fear River Watch advocacy group and the Chemours Company. It outlines an agreement addressing the GenX-contaminated well water used by hundreds of thousands NC residents. 
	
	The  consent order will not be binding until a judge rules on its merits, DEQ spokesperson Megan Thorpe told the Sundial; and there will be no ruling until the public has a chance to say its part during a 30-day comment period, &#x201C;which won&#x2019;t [end] until December 21,&#x201D; Thorpe said. 
	
	&#x201C;People directly affected by Chemours&#x2019; actions need an opportunity to comment on this extensive document,&#x201D; Thorpe said. This feedback could potentially lead to changes in the language of the consent order. It can be made over phone, email or mail, as detailed at the DEQ &lt;a href="https://deq.nc.gov/news/press-releases/2018/11/21/release-state-officials-require-chemours-provide-permanent-drinking" target="_blank"&gt;website&lt;font color="#b00000"&gt;.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
	
	GenX is a brand name for a technology used to create some high-performance nonstick chemical coatings for cookware and other products. GenX is one of many new polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), synthetic chemicals used in industrial settings since the 1940s. 
	
	On November 8, the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) published a &lt;a href="https://www.ncdhhs.gov/news/press-releases/dhhs-releases-analysis-selected-birth-defects-five-southeastern-north-carolina" target="_blank"&gt;review &lt;/a&gt; showing PFAS-linked birth defects were higher in the Cape Fear Region from 2003-2014 than in the rest of the state. (There are no national data for comparison.) &#x201C;The review showed some central nervous system and cardiac defects were higher in one or more of the five counties [Bladen, Brunswick, Cumberland, New Hanover and Pender counties] examined compared with the state average,&#x201D; the press release stated. However, &#x201C;For reasons that are not well understood, the prevalence of brain anomalies varied substantially across North Carolina and higher prevalence was not limited to the lower Cape Fear region.&#x201D; Caution in interpretation was urged because the number of birth defects is small, making generalizations more of a gamble.
	
	&#x201C;Because birth defects can be caused by a complex mix of genetic, medical, behavioral and environmental factors, no conclusions regarding links between PFAS or other exposures and birth defects can be drawn from this analysis,&#x201D; the review concluded. Nonetheless, the higher rate of defects is a fact.
	
	The agreement would require Chemours to extend some aid to businesses and homes whose water has been polluted by GenX and to take preventative measures against pollution. 
	
	Members of the public may submit comment until December 21.
	
	The Cape Fear Public Utility Authority, located in New Hanover County,  has publicly &lt;a href="https://www.cfpua.org/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=965" target="_blank"&gt;announced &lt;/a&gt; concerns with the consent order, saying clean-up efforts do not extend far enough downstream.
	
		
	
	Chemours has been on the radar of state regulators since at least June of 2017, when the Wilmington Star-News broke a story that scientists had discovered GenX in the Cape Fear River and nearby wells that supplied water to the surrounding communities. 
	
	The consent order, which has not yet been filed in the Bladen County Superior Court, does not see Chemours admit culpability. Instead, the company could avoid future litigation by paying the state $12 million in fines, providing a permanent and safe water source to affected homes and businesses, and installing thermal oxidizers to reduce hazardous air pollution, among other stipulations. 
	
	The consent order says Chemours must also &#x201C;continue to capture for off-site disposal all process wastewater from its operations at the Facility unless or until an NPDES [National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System] Permit is issued authorizing the discharge of process wastewater.&#x201D;
	
	 
	
	DEQ said in a &lt;a href="http://deq.nc.gov/news/press-releases/2018/11/21/release-state-officials-require-chemours-provide-permanent-drinking" target="_blank"&gt;statement &lt;/a&gt; that Chemours will also be responsible for drafting its own &#x201C;corrective Action Plan that, once approved, is implemented and reduces PFAS contributions in groundwater along the Cape Fear River by at least 75 percent.&#x201D; 
	
	On November 14, the federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) released a toxicity assessment for GenX chemicals. The accompanying fact sheet claimed that 0.00008 kg/mg per day over the course of a lifetime is the threshold for adverse health effects. 
	
	DEQ Assistant Secretary Sheila Holman told WHQR Public Radio that, as it is currently written, the order &#x201C;will mean that no one in the community will be drinking water with measurable PFAS concentrations above 10 parts per trillion.&#x201D;</body>

    <title>UNC May Re-house Silent Sam With New Building, More Security</title>
    <subhead>Potential price tag $5.3 million</subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>CHAPEL HILL &#x2014; The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill is still attempting to carve a path forward in the ongoing dispute over the controversial Silent Sam monument, with each step in the process raising the ire of those who wish to see the statue restored to its pedestal &#x2014; and others who would prefer that it remain out of sight permanently. 
	
	This past week, the UNC Board of Trustees and Chancellor Carol Folt proposed a plan to house the toppled Confederate statue away from the center of campus, as a heavily guarded, &#x201C;content-neutral&#x201D; public display. It would be housed in a yet-to-be-constructed building with a price tag of $5.3 million.
	
	At their regular meeting on Monday, December 3, Folt and the trustees explained their dilemma: a 2015 state law that forbids relocating historical markers without approval from the General Assembly&#x2019;s Historical Commission, so moving the statue to an off-site educational facility or museum is not a legal solution. Instead, the proposal names Odum Village, near the school&#x2019;s hospital complex, as an alternative place of preservation for Silent Sam, still on campus. 
	
	The published version of the proposal included an appendix that outlined the findings of a special security panel. The evaluation of five law enforcement experts with experience at the local and federal level described a &#x201C;high risk [of] violence, civil disorder and property damage,&#x201D; if the school re-erects Silent Sam. 
	
	&#x201C;The capability of the UNC-Chapel Hill Campus Police Department to prevent civil disorder and violence is very limited,&#x201D; the panel found. It suggested a system-wide security overhaul that includes training a &#x201C;mobile force platoon&#x201D; of officers designed to respond to violence.
	
	 
	
	While the Trustees may have understood that any compromise meant to satisfy a community this polarized would encounter resistance, the level of outrage, both online and off, has some wondering if the Board of Governors will reject the plan outright. 
	
	Thom Goolsby, a Board of Governors member and outspoken critic of those activists demanding the monument&#x2019;s permanent removal from campus, posted a video on his YouTube channel accusing the Trustees of &#x201C;sheer cowardice,&#x201D; and asserting that their attempt to appease the &#x201C;both the right and left&#x201D; made no one happy.
	
	&#x201C;If you try to be everything to everyone, you end up being nothing to anyone,&#x201D; Goolsby said. &#x201C;Silent Sam should have been put back up in its place within 90 days of the outside radicals tearing it down.&#x201D; That would have been by November 18.
	
	Mere hours after the proposal was made public, hundreds of protestors gathered on Franklin Street near McCorkle Place to vent their frustration. Present in the crowd was doctoral candidate and student leader Maya Little, whose defacing of the statue in April resulted in national headlines and her criminal conviction in Orange County court. 
	
	Speaking to protestors, Little harshly criticized Folt and the Trustees for encouraging an unsafe learning environment through increased &#x201C;policing and surveillance of student and community protesters.&#x201D;
	
	The Board of Governors is scheduled to consider the proposal at its December 14 meeting. If they choose to approve it, the next step will involve Chapel Hill campus representatives petitioning the North Carolina Historical Commission for an official exemption to state law, allowing Silent Sam to be moved indoors.

    <title>Congressional Race Unresolved in 9th District, Mail-In Ballot Fraud Suspected</title>
    <subhead></subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>RALEIGH &#x2014; State elections officials have refused to approve midterm election results for the state&#x2019;s Ninth Congressional District, and have launched a fraud inquiry into suspicions of ballot tampering by a campaign operative of the winning candidate.
	
	Fishy mail-in ballot figures and reports of illegal absentee ballot collection &#x2014; purported elections officials going door-to-door, for example &#x2014; in Bladen and Robeson counties have caused the State Board of Elections and Ethics Enforcement (SBEEE) to twice vote to withhold certification of the congressional race, as well as local Bladen County races.
	
	In general election results, Republican candidate Mark Harris beat out Democrat Dan McCready for the congressional seat by 905 votes in November&#x2019;s election; these totals have been called into question, and the North Carolina Republican Party&#x2019;s executive director has said he would be open to a new election if fraud affected the outcome of the November 6 election.
	
	McCready withdrew his concession on December 6, shortly after Washington Post reporters Amy Gardner and Ben Reinhard published a story on irregularities in the both the primary and general elections this year.
	
	The criminal probe was preceded by revelations from campaign staffers for incumbent Robert Pittenger, Harris&#x2019; opponent in the Republican primary, that the district&#x2019;s absentee ballot count seemed suspect. While Pittenger lost the party nomination by 828 votes (17,302 to 16,474), the total difference between the two candidates among mail-in absentee voters was markedly disproportionate &#x2014; Harris&#x2019; 437 to Pittenger&#x2019;s 17.
	
	Pittenger aides say they immediately informed both the North Carolina Republican Party and the National Republican Congressional Committee regional political director that they believed the discrepancy was likely the consequence of unscrupulous vote tampering &#x2014; specifically in Bladen County.
	
	North Carolina Republican Party leaders, however, are denying that the Pittenger team ever reached out. Chairman Robin Hayes told The Charlotte Observer on Thursday, December 6 that &#x201C;Robert Pittenger didn&#x2019;t say anything to me [about the primary].&#x201D;
	
	In the same statement, Hayes then equivocated, saying the allegation &#x201C;may have been mentioned... At the end of an election there are hundreds of issues to deal with.&#x201D;
	
	According to a &lt;a href="https://www.ncsbe.gov/press-releases?udt_2226_param_detail=220" target="_blank"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; from SBEEE sent to media on the afternoon of December 7, much of the state board's investigation is centered on the activities of Republican political operative Leslie McCrae Dowless, who spearheaded Harris&#x2019; get-out-the-vote effort throughout both the primary and general elections.
	
	&#x201C;The agency confirms that Leslie McCrae Dowless Jr. is a person of interest in connection with an alleged absentee ballot operation in the congressional district.,&#x201D; the statement read.
	
	&#x201C;The State Board has issued subpoenas for documents to Red Dome Group, the Mark Harris for Congress Committee and the James Atlas McVicker Committee... An evidentiary hearing will be scheduled as soon as possible, and State Board staff will send out a notice as soon as details are final.&#x201D;
	
	The Red Dome Group is the political consultancy firm that employs Dowless, who has been on election officials&#x2019; radar since at least 2016, when accusations of ballot harvesting &#x2014; the act of paying people to collect unsealed absentee ballots &#x2014; first surfaced. Public records indicate that Harris&#x2019; organization paid out a total of $428,911 to Red Dome this election cycle.
	
	Harris still owes $53,000 to Red Dome, $34,000 of which is a &#x201C;reimbursment payment for Bladen absentee work.&#x201D;
	
	Dowless has denied any wrongdoing on his part.
	
	North Carolina Republican Party leaders have walked back their vehement denial of illegal activities, with GOP Executive Director Dallas Woodhouse telling Post journalists that if state investigators can muster &#x201C;substantial evidence&#x201D; of fraud, he would support a do-over special election.
	
	&#x201C;The media has done a tremendous public service in exposing incredible political corruption that has gone on back over a decade in this area of the state, something that has got to be rooted out,&#x201D; Woodhouse said to MSNBC&#x2019;s Hallie Jackson in an interview that aired on Friday, December 7. &#x201C;But as good as those media reports are, we have to let the state board of elections come forward with a determination of whether this race could have been overturned or there was a substantial likelihood of it being overturned before we make the determination of a new election.
	
	&#x201C;If they reach that standard, we will absolutely support that election,&#x201D; Woodhouse continued.
	
	Woodhouse acknowledged to Jackson that the state Republican Party received complaints from Pittenger&#x2019;s campaign after the incumbent&#x2019;s loss in the May primary.
	
	&#x201C;Mr. Pittenger didn&#x2019;t come to me,&#x201D; Woodhouse said in the interview. &#x201C;We did hear some things, I think, from his campaign staff in the days after an election. I&#x2019;m not excusing this, but in the days after a primary, which we are prevented from being a part of, we often hear complaints about people, about how things turned out. We listen, but it often does not register.&#x201D;
	
	Patrick Gannon, the press secretary for the North Carolina State Board of Elections, spoke to the Sundial by phone on whether the October decision by a three-panel judge declaring the Board&#x2019;s current make-up unconstitutional will affect the investigation. Gannon said he &#x201C;was not privy&#x201D; to the political machinations involved, but that the non-elected staff members leading the probe are &#x201C;protected by North Carolina Human Resources&#x201D; from unjust firings.
	
	Wake County District Attorney Lorrin Freeman and the State Bureau of Investigation are conducting their own investigations into the allegations. The SBEE also investigation 2016 voting irregularities in the district.
	
	According to statistics published by the North Carolina Board of Elections and Ethics Enforcement (NCBEE), Bladen county had 23,288 registered voters as of November 6: 12,529 registered Democrats and 4,120 registered Republicans, 6,596 unaffiliated and 43 voters registered to other political parties.
	
	North Carolina&#x2019;s 9th district covers the counties of Union, Anson, Richmond, Scotland and Robeson, and portions of Mecklenburg, Cumberland and Bladen counties.

    <title>Errors in NC Rape Kit Procedure May Have Kept Aguilar&#x2019;s Accused Murderer Free</title>
    <subhead></subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>LUMBERTON &#x2014; Revelations in the case of a Lumberton 13-year-old girl whose body was found in Robeson County roughly three weeks after her kidnapping may illustrate how delays in North Carolina&#x2019;s system of testing rape kits (DNA evidence collected from victims of sexual assault to identify perpetrators) have become a detriment to public safety. 
	
	State Attorney General Josh Stein revealed this past February that 15,000 kits across 563 agencies remain untested after a statewide rape kit audit, and even those tested may not be followed-up on. 
	
	Michael Ray McLellan, the man being charged with the abduction, rape and murder of Hania Noelia Aguilar, whose body was discovered on November 27, has since Aguilar&#x2019;s death been charged with a 2016 sexual assault. DNA evidence from that crime was matched to the man's DNA in 2017 and the match reported to local authorities, who did not act on the information.
	
	Prosecutors have brought criminal charges that present Aguilar's death as a possible consequence of the state&#x2019;s rape kit system&#x2019;s shortcomings.
	
	The kidnapping of Aguilar captured headlines, and law enforcement agencies posted offers of cash rewards for information leading to her safe return. The eighth-grader was kidnapped during daylight and thrown into a vehicle on November 5. The tragic outcome &#x2014; her body was found near a road 22 days after she was taken &#x2014; has attracted national attention.
	
	Robeson County District Attorney Johnson Britt held a press conference on Wednesday, December 12, during which he informed reporters that, in a private conversation with Aguilar&#x2019;s mother, he said that &#x201C;her daughter might be alive&#x201D; if the Robeson County Sheriff&#x2019;s Office had followed proper procedure with evidence implicating her alleged killer&#x2019;s involvement in a previous assault case.
	
	&#x201C;It was a difficult conversation to have,&#x201D; Britt said. &#x201C;Maybe the most difficult conversation I&#x2019;ve had with a victim&#x2019;s family. Had it [a matched rape kit] been followed up on, her daughter might be alive.&#x201D;
	
	In 2016, McLellan was DNA-matched to a rape kit from a rape reported, also in Robeson County. The rape kit&#x2019;s resulting DNA paired with DNA in a federal database from a previous felony conviction of McLellan. The state crime lab sent this result to the Robeson County district attorney&#x2019;s office, still under Britt at the time, which sent them to the sheriff&#x2019;s office. The next procedural step was for the sheriff&#x2019;s office to locate McLellan to confirm the results with a new genetic sample. If that also matched, he may have been held and prosecuted for the rape and, as Britt hypothesized, would not have been free to allegedly commit further crime.
	
	&#x201C;Had we made an arrest, in all likely Mr. McLellan would have remained in jail because of his prior history and because of the severity of the charges, and we would have avoided Hania&#x2019;s death,&#x201D; Britt said.
	
	The information package delivered to the sheriff&#x2019;s office in 2017 also had a backup disc; that is also missing.
	
	Meghan Clement, a forensic DNA and serology consultant of Clement Consulting, said that rape kit matches are very accurate. &#x201C;With the traditional autosomal DNA testing, which is what every laboratory in the country does, [a genetic profile] is unique to individuals except identical siblings,&#x201D; Clement said. &#x201C;Generally it is unique as long as they have gotten sufficient genetic information. And usually they have to have a certain amount to run it through the database so by that point it would be considered unique.
	
	&#x201C;That could give probable cause to arrest someone; they have to follow up and get another sample [from the suspect] and usually run it as a verification.&#x201D;
	
	McLellan is now being prosecuted for the 2016 crime. The trial is scheduled to begin on January 7, 2019, about two weeks after his trial for crimes against Aguilar commences on December 21, 2018.
	
	Sheriff Burnis Wilkins, who took over the office this past election, issued a written statement to Raleigh television station WRAL on December 12 announcing an internal affairs investigation into why no action was taken at the time, saying that &#x201C;once we determine what occurred, the citizens will be made aware of the findings." He reported that procedure has already been changed to increase accountability.
	
	Ilse Knecht, Director of Policy and Advocacy for the Joyful Heart Foundation, an organization with a mission of changing &#x201C;society&#x2019;s response to sexual assault,&#x201D; told the Sundial that the majority of rape kits are handled by municipal, county and state forensics teams, and that &#x201C;very few make it to [the federal] level&#x201D; the way Aguilar&#x2019;s did. For example, the one for the alleged 2016 assault was handled by the state. Local and state sex crime units are &#x201C;often woefully underfunded and understaffed,&#x201D; she said.
	
	&#x201C;The problem is basically the criminal justice system doesn&#x2019;t treat sexual assault like the violent crime that it is. That means they don&#x2019;t put the funding into the system to respond to sexual violence.&#x201D; 
	
	Broader societal attitudes such as classism and sexism exacerbate the problem, Knecht said, especially in more vulnerable communities, such as the Hispanic immigrant population of which Aguilar was a part.
	
	Knecht noted that while the probe into the Sheriff&#x2019;s Office and its inaction may simply reveal a team of overworked but well-intentioned investigators who missed a signal in the noise, the Aguilar case is still indicative of &#x201C;why we don't only need to test the [rape kits] but we have to investigate the cases that come out of the testing.
	
	"This has happened in other places where a hit notification sits on a detective's desk and then something horrible happens,&#x201D; she said, referring to the alert that the genetic information has been matched to a person in the system. &#x201C;It's a terrible lesson to learn and a horrible way to learn it... It&#x2019;s also why we've worked so hard to ensure that any federal funding that goes out to test kits also includes funding to investigate and prosecute.&#x201D;
	
	After the disclosure of a 15,000-kit backlog in February, the General Assembly passed House Bill 945, which seeks to address the problem at multiple levels by establishing the Statewide Sexual Assault Evidence Collection Kit Tracking and Information Management System (STIMS), to ensure &#x201C;that every sexual assault evidence collection kit in North Carolina be tested.&#x201D;
	
	The law, which took effect on October 1, requires compliance by &#x201C;any law enforcement agency, medical provider, or forensic laboratory that has in its custody a previously untested sexual assault evidence collection kit used for a forensic medical examination.&#x201D;
	
	The state backlog is also making the jobs of municipal and county law enforcement investigators harder. An officer in the Triangle, who asked not to be named in this article, said that in such cases, &#x201C;I [will] have a victim who wants and deserves closure who isn&#x2019;t going to get it, and is going to blame us because we aren&#x2019;t doing enough."
	
	&#x201C;Then the next time they ask for help or we need their help, it&#x2019;s going to be remembered,&#x201D; the officer added. 
	
	District Attorney Britt said that when they informed Aguilar&#x2019;s mother about the error in handling the relevant rape kit, leaving McLellan uninvestigated, she asked if they had fixed the problem and closed the gap. &#x201C;We assured her that we are working on that,&#x201D; he said.
	
	In accordance with the above-mentioned new law, the North Carolina Department of Public Safety was charged with drafting a proposal on how to test the entire backlog efficiently, and to submit a written plan to the General Assembly by December 1, although DPS has not yet provided a public statement addressing the deadline. DPS has not responded to the Sundial&#x2019;s request for comment.
	
	McLellan appeared in court on Monday, December 10 for the Aguilar case, and a Robeson County judge revoked his bond. Britt said McLellan will be moved to a Raleigh jail, citing security concerns.
	
	When DNA in the SUV used to kidnap Aguilar was linked to McLellan, he was already in custody, on charges of possession of a firearm by a felon, second-degree kidnapping and attempt to rob with a dangerous weapon.
	
	The Piedmont Sundial reports on law enforcement investigations, arrests and all criminal proceedings from the standpoint that under the United States Constitution every person is presumed innocent under the law unless found guilty in court.</body>

    <title>Bribery, Fraud and Murder-for-Hire Alleged Against Three Russian Raleigh Residents</title>
    <subhead></subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>RALEIGH &#x2014; Two married Russian nationals and an associate living in North Raleigh, as well as two more associates in Illinois, were indicted on multiple charges including money laundering, bribery and immigration fraud; the husband is also accused of planning murder-for-hire. The two-year FBI investigation of a kickback scheme involving work for the Russian military culminated in a raid on their $7.8 million mansion on New Market Way, a wealthy neighborhood which includes the Northridge Country Club. 
	
	The investigation was extended beyond that one property, as Federal agents discovered a &#x201C;safehouse&#x201D; at 510 Glenwood Avenue. The existence of this unfurnished condominium and its contents, which included cash and weapons, was made public on Tuesday, December 18 at the case&#x2019;s bond hearing in the U.S. district court in Raleigh.   
	
	Assistant U.S. Attorney Barbara Kocher told Judge Robert Numbers II that she was not sure if there were any additional safehouses, but that it was possible other properties could be discovered.
	
	Judge Numbers declined to issue bond to Leonid, and he will remain in custody. Tatyana is out on bail, but was required to surrender her passport. 
	
	The unsealed indictment filed by the United States Attorney&#x2019;s Office in Raleigh alleges that Leonid Teyf, his wife Tatyana and an Illinois associate gathered kickbacks totaling more than $150 million while working with Russian company Voentorg (translated, &#x201C;military trade&#x201D;), for which Leonid was serving as Deputy Director. The money was allegedly deposited in both domestic accounts and accounts in &#x201C;countries commonly known to be used for money laundering.&#x201D;
	
	According Don Connelly, public information officer for the Eastern District of N.C. U.S. Attorney Office, while a senior executive at Voentorg, &#x201C;Teyf and others devised a scheme requiring the subcontractor to agree that a certain percentage of the government funds it would receive for completion of the work would be paid back to [Leonid] and other parties.&#x201D; In essence, this accused theft was from the Russian government itself.
	
	The Teyfs were allegedly availing themselves of at least one American bank&#x2019;s services &#x2014; the institution is neither indicted nor named &#x2014; in the form of nearly 300 wire transfers. It is alleged that these transactions originated from &#x201C;foreign corporations and bank accounts in countries commonly known to be used for money laundering.&#x201D; 
	
	All five defendants named in the indictment also face immigration fraud charges. Tatyana and a married Russian couple in Illinois with &#x201C;conspiring, and aiding and abetting one another to encourage and induce an alien to come to, enter, or reside in the United States&#x201D; knowing for the person to do so would be criminal. Leonid and another Russian Raleigh resident, Alexei Polyakov, misrepresented themselves to obtain a visa and naturalization respectively.
	
	The criminal acts laid out in both the indictment and in the U.S. Attorney&#x2019;s press release allege more than monetary crimes for Leonid Teyf, the husband of the Raleigh pair; he is accused of hiring someone for murder, and providing a firearm with a destroyed serial number for the act.
	
	During the course of their operations, federal agents recruited a &#x201C;confidential source&#x201D; close to the couple to help build their case. The source &#x201C;learned that Leonid Teyf came to believe that Tatyana was having an affair with another man.&#x201D; Purportedly, Leonid then recruited the source &#x201C;to assist in planning for the man&#x2019;s murder. The murder was to take place here in the United States or in Russia after they conspired to have the man deported,&#x201D; the press release reads. Leonid reportedly paid the man $25,000 to follow through with the hit before 2019. 
	
	As part of this plan, Leonid attempted to have his wife&#x2019;s supposed lover deported by bribing a Department of Homeland Security employee, a plan that failed because the official was also working undercover with the FBI. 
	
	University of Toronto Professor of Criminology Mathew Light, who has published extensively on the Soviet and post-Soviet Russian justice system, spoke to the Sundial by phone. &#x201C;It is a very strange story... The part of [this case] that makes it politically sensitive is that the Russian weapons industry is very closely connected to the Russian government, which is not on very good terms with the U.S. right now, and is implicated in various major scandals.&#x201D; What the Russian government&#x2019;s public reaction will be, Light does not speculate.
	
	Light also noted, &#x201C;It is well known the Russian defense industry employs bribery and kickbacks to secure contracts on a very large scale.&#x201D; So though this case may seem unusual, Russian business interests working abroad have a history of similar accusation. &#x201C;The U.S. and other western governments are constrained by their own domestic laws&#x2026;[like] the [American] Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which states that it is in most circumstances illegal for U.S. businesses and individuals to bribe foreign officials&#x201D; as Leonid tried with the Department of Homeland Security employee.
	
	Russia does have a broad federal anti-corruption law that criminalizes both passive and active bribery, but compliance in the private sector is not enforced at similar levels as the West, according to Light.
	
	Leonid will be arraigned in New Bern, N.C., the week of February 12. If convicted in federal court, Leonid would face a maximum sentence of 20 years&#x2019; incarceration, while Tatyana and other conspirators would face 10. &#x201C;The government will also seek to seize over $39 million in assets from the defendants,&#x201D; according to the press statement.
	
	&#x201C;Each defendant will likely face the prospect of removal from the United States after their terms of imprisonment.&#x201D;</body>

    <title>North Carolina Lawmakers Could See "Cannabill" for Medical Marijuana in 2019</title>
    <subhead></subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>RALEIGH &#x2014; In 2019, North Carolina could possibly join the growing list of states legalizing marijuana for medical use.
	
	N.C. House Member Kelly Alexander, a Democrat from Charlotte representing District 107, is building a coalition of politicians and activists to advocate for a bill set to be introduced in the General Assembly in January or February.  
	
	Medical marijuana bills have previously been introduced in the North Carolina General Assembly to no success, including one Alexander sponsored in the 2017-2018 session, but the state lawmaker thinks that a bill this upcoming year has a fighting chance.
	
	Statewide elections in November 2018 edged Democratic membership in the House and Senate chambers of the North Carolina General Assembly for the upcoming 2019-2020 session, a fact Alexander said he hopes will set conditions for the state&#x2019;s first law legalizing marijuana use in certain medical contexts.
	
	"We have a much greater chance of getting something through this time than we have had in previous years,&#x201D; he said. "The governor's office is now willing to discuss it.&#x201D;
	
	The Piedmont Sundial reached out to the office of Governor Roy Cooper about potential support for legalized medical marijuana in North Carolina, but has yet to receive its response. 
	
	A 2017 poll conducted by Elon University placed North Carolina public opinion at 80 percent in favor of some sort of legislation making Cannabis sativa and its primary psychoactive ingredient, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), available to patients. 
	
	But high levels of popular support do not guarantee the passage of a bill in the North Carolina General Assembly. And despite the loss of its supermajority, the House will remain under the control of Republican lawmakers, who did not support any of the pro-marijuana legalization bills, medical or otherwise, that were introduced in the 2017-2018 session.
	
	One of those bills, sponsored by Senate Member Paul Lowe, would have raised the amounts of marijuana possession necessary to incur certain criminal misdemeanor and felony classifications. Lowe's bill did not reach a floor vote during the 2017-2018 legislative session. 
	
	Legalized medical marijuana, established with state licensing for distribution centers and growing operations under the North Carolina Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, would bring in an estimated $250 million per year in state revenues according to the bill Alexander introduced in 2017.
	
	The bill Alexander cosponsored in 2017 would have made medical marijuana available for patients diagnosed with a plethora of medical conditions and disorders, including cancer, HIV, celiac and Crohn's diseases, osteoporosis, Tourette's syndrome and rheumatoid arthritis. 
	
	The 2017 bill Alexander cosponsored would also have established a North Carolina Cannabis Research Program which would task the University of North Carolina to "undertake objective scientific research regarding the efficacy and safety of administering cannabis as part of medical treatment."
	
	Alexander, first elected in 2008, is the son of former NAACP Board of Directors Chairman Kelly Alexander Sr., and the younger Alexander himself served as president of the N.C. chapter of the organization. 
	
	Alexander said he believes that a new bill&#x2019;s supporters can build support upon the Democrats&#x2019; legislative wins this past November, and &#x201C;a recognition by the voters that the [Republican] supermajority wasn't to their advantage&#x201D; will further spur momentum.
	
	Garrett Perdue, an organizer with the reform group Sensible South, said that his group finds the proposed bill &#x201C;a little bit too aggressive, given the current political climate in North Carolina." 
	
	Perdue said that passage would be more likely with a bill that prohibits the &#x201C;smoking of flower,&#x201D; meaning no joints, pipes, bongs or other popular methods of burning plant matter. He also sees the &#x201C;homegrow&#x201D; component of many medical cannabis bills in other states, which allows for personal cultivation by qualified patients, as a deal breaker in North Carolina. He went on to describe Alexander&#x2019;s plan as "a little too lenient&#x2026;to get the [General Assembly] comfortable with any sort of legislative advance."  
	
	A 2017 poll conducted by Elon University places North Carolina public opinion at 80 percent in favor of some sort of legislation making Cannabis sativa and its primary psychoactive ingredient tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) available to patients. But such high levels of popular support do not guarantee the passage of a bill. And despite the loss of its supermajority, the House will remain under the control of the GOP, a party with virtually no public support for any pro-marijuana legislation, medical or otherwise. 
	
	The closest precedent is the state&#x2019;s 2014 Epilepsy Alternative Treatment Act, which created a framework for the legal dispensation of cannabidiol (CBD), derived from marijuana. CBD, a chemical compound found in cannabis with significantly fewer psychoactive properties than THC, is allowed in a medical context under doctor&#x2019;s supervision. Thanks to the 2014 Farm Bill passed by the United States Congress, retail shops operating within the parameters of the lightly regulated nutritional supplement market are able to sell CBD products manufactured from industrial hemp rather than the cannabis flower, if the THC content is under 0.3 percent.  According to some legal experts, however, N.C. laws related to CBD remain murky. 
	
	Over the last 10 years, numerous states have legalized or decriminalized the weed (decriminalization means loosened restrictions and/or decreased penalties). This past election cycle, Michigan voters voted to allow recreational sales, following Washington, Oregon, California, Nevada, Colorado, Alaska, Massachusetts, Vermont, Maine and the District of Columbia. Utah joined 22 states, districts and commonwealths in establishing a medicalized system for those with specific ailments.
	
	Karen O&#x2019;Keefe, director of state policies for the Marijuana Policy Project (MPP), says marijuana usage has been shown to be beneficial by scientific evidence, at least with regard to medical use. MPP is an advocacy organization that works on campaigns nationwide. "There was a report by the National Academy of Sciences that came out in early 2017, and they found that there was conclusive evidence that medical cannabis alleviates chronic pain, and strong evidence that it also helps with nausea and appetite loss," she said, referring to a meta-study that reviewed approximately 10,000 scientific abstracts. The report made a formal recommendation to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that expanding &#x201C;access to research-grade marijuana, through the creation and approval of new facilities for growing and storing cannabis&#x201D; was in the interest of public health.      
	
	O&#x2019;Keefe says the federal government has made it &#x201C;very difficult to study cannabis," but research coming out of other countries is also compelling; for example, in 2011 the Israel Medical Association Journal published research out of Tel Aviv University indicating that &#x201C;half of patients administered cannabis went into complete remission from Crohn's disease," a particularly debilitating version of inflammatory bowel syndrome that significantly reduces quality of life.
	
	The original plan for Representative Alexander&#x2019;s proposed bill was to allow individual counties to vote to opt in or out of the law, but there is a complication, according to Alexander, who says a localized referendum for legislation related to healthcare may be prohibited by &#x201C;a clause in the [state] constitution.&#x201D; 
	
	Alexander says that that was the issue with the 2017-2018 bill, which shared co-sponsors with the newest bill. &#x201C;Since we&#x2019;ve had that first draft run into the constitutional issues, we&#x2019;re obviously trying to come to a consensus as to exactly which direction we want to move in.&#x201D;
	
	Both last session&#x2019;s bill and a 2014 medical marijuana bill only made it into the Committee on Rules, Calendar, and Operations of the House.
	
	Bills to support legalized marijuana, even strictly for medical uses, have gotten resistance from some national organizations and think tanks, such as Smart Approaches to Marijuana (SAM), which warns against a public health disaster in the making. 
	
	&#x201C;You want to have medicines that go through clinical trials and are verified by science,&#x201D; said SAM spokesperson Luke Niforatos. &#x201C;When it comes to medical marijuana, we think science should guide. No other medication is being put up to a majority vote, whether by legislators or citizens.&#x201D; 
	
	SAM&#x2019;s website cites studies indicating that marijuana is addictive and dangerous, particularly to adolescents.
	
	The SAM site also adds, &#x201C;The increase in support for legalization reflects the tens of millions of dollars poured into the legalization movement over the past 30 years. Legalization is not inevitable and there is evidence to show that support has stalled since 2013.&#x201D; Additionally, SAM writes, &#x201C;Legalization is about one thing: making a small number of business people rich.&#x201D;
	
	SAM advocates civil, not criminal, penalties for marijuana violations, and Niforatos says the organization is best described as &#x201C;anti-commercial&#x201D; in mission. &#x201C;Listen, we don&#x2019;t want people to go to jail for smoking a joint,&#x201D; said Niforatos. &#x201C;What we don&#x2019;t want to see are commercial sales and pot shops... We would oppose any kind of legislation that would create that kind of environment.
	
	Niforatos claims that well-known tobacco companies and executives are poised to take over the recreational cannabis market as it expands across the country.
	
	 &#x201C;Free-market capitalism has a dark side,&#x201D; Niforatos said, &#x201C;Look at Big Tobacco and what has happened in the last 100 years; that was a complete unmitigated disaster that we are still paying the price for.&#x201D; 
	
	In 1977, North Carolina lawmakers approved a bill in 1977 that reduced the criminal classification for possession of up to one ounce of marijuana from a felony to a misdemeanor. State law currently classifies simple possession of 0.5 to 1.5 ounces of marijuana as a class 1 misdemeanor. Police departments in some municipalities, including Durham, have publicly deprioritized marijuana arrests. 
	
	It appears that those organizations that continue to advocate maintaining current federal drug sentencing guidelines and punitive policing are finding themselves on the fringe of the discourse. Even President Bill Clinton has changed his mind on approaches. In 1994 he pushed for a broader crime-control initiative named the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act and endorsed the federal &#x201C;three-strikes&#x201D; where serious drug offenses in combination with &#x201C;serious violent felonies&#x201D; mandate a life sentence. Since leaving office Clinton has admitted that it was misguided and perhaps did more harm than good.   
	
	There is still resistance &#x201C;from some in law enforcement,&#x201D; said O&#x2019;Keefe. Two incidents involving police activism this past midterm election cycle caused controversy in Utah and North Dakota, where the voters of each state passed medical marijuana referendums. In both cases, law enforcement officers were publicly chastised for making use of official social media in opposing the campaigns in their respective states. 
	
	O&#x2019;Keefe says, &#x201C;We have had 20 years since the first medical marijuana law passed to understand that these can be written in a way that won't cause problems [for police]." 
	
	A 2017 Pew Center survey of 8,000 law enforcement officers nationwide found that almost two-thirds of those interviewed were in favor of either medical or recreational cannabis.</body>

    <title>Winston-Salem's Mayor Threatens Lawsuit to Remove Confederate Monument</title>
    <subhead></subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>WINSTON-SALEM &#x2014; In a speech made at Winston-Salem&#x2019;s annual Emancipation Proclamation anniversary ceremony on Tuesday, January 1, Mayor Allen Joines directed a local United Daughters of the Confederacy (UDC) chapter to permanently remove its Confederate soldier statue from downtown by the end of the month or risk legal action.
	
	&#x201C;We&#x2019;ve already had two instances of vandalism,&#x201D; Joines said, addressing the sizeable crowd gathered at Mount Pleasant Missionary Baptist Church on the last day of Kwanzaa. &#x201C;Therefore, we are directing the Daughters of the Confederacy to remove it, and if they don&#x2019;t, we&#x2019;re prepared to file legal action to achieve that removal.&#x201D;
	
	The monument stands downtown at the corner of West Fourth Street and North Liberty Street beside the historic Forsyth County Courthouse. 
	
	Its most recent defacement on Christmas Day, when somebody scrawled &#x201C;cowards &amp;amp; traitors&#x201D; along its base in black permanent marker. A previous incident occurred on August 18. 
	
	The statue depicts a nameless infantryman with his musket upright, its butt planted near his feet, and a plaque reading "Our Confederate Dead" fixed to its front pedestal.&amp;nbsp; The rear plaque reads "As Southern Soldiers Of The War Of 1861-1865, They Share The Fame That Mankind Awards To The Heroes Who Served In That Great Conflict."&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The description also details its 1905 erection by the James B. Gordon Chapter of the UDC.
	
	The recent controversy has placed the UDC statue on a growing list of Confederate-heritage landmarks from the Jim Crow era in North Carolina now the target of removal campaigns by activist groups. Raleigh and Asheville have seen disputes over such but the most well-known of which is Chapel Hill&#x2019;s &#x201C;Silent Sam&#x201D; sculpture of a nameless young Confederate soldier, toppled in August of 2018.
	
	In a letter sent to select UDC members, city attorney Angela Carmon wrote that given &#x201C;the intensity of the most recent message left by vandals...I indicated a concern about potential breaches to the peace and the strong likelihood that, given the intensity of the message, that breaches of peace are likely to occur.&#x201D;
	
	&#x201C;Failure to comply with this direction may result in the city seeking a court order,&#x201D; Carmon said, in order to &#x201C;address public safety concerns that are escalating as the messages left by vandals intensify after each incident.&#x201D;
	
	Also present on Tuesday was city council member Denise &#x201C;D.D.&#x201D; Adams, who voiced a similar urgency. &#x201C;In the heat of the night, people may come through like ninja warriors and take that statue down,&#x201D; Adams said.
	
	The Cultural History Artifact Management and Patriotism Act, which passed through the North Carolina General Assembly in 2015, stipulates that no &#x201C;object of remembrance&#x201D; on public property, Confederate or otherwise, &#x201C;may be removed, relocated, or altered in any way without the approval of the North Carolina Historical Commission.&#x201D; The UDC statue in Winston-Salem, however, is now sitting on private real estate owned by Winston Courthouse, LLC; both Jones and Carmon claim this fact grants the city a right to issue its directive for removal, &#x201C;in order to minimize public safety concerns. </body>

    <title>Columbus County Sheriff Office Still Contested, Investigated; Incumbent Candidate Sues Sworn-in Competitor</title>
    <subhead></subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>&lt;div&gt;WHITEVILLE, N.C. &#x2014; The 2018 Democratic candidate for Sheriff of Columbus County, former incumbent Lewis Hatcher, will take his Republican opponent in November's contested general election, Jody Greene, to court for the office.&amp;nbsp;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a motion filed by his legal team in Columbus Superior Court Friday, January 4, Hatcher&#x2019;s legal counsel, Oscar M. Blanks III, called Greene, the acting sheriff, &#x201C;a Usurper of authority&#x201D; who &#x201C;is unlawfully holding the Office of Sheriff of Columbus County, thus placing the citizens in grave risk.&#x201D;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;Hatcher, who was first appointed and then elected to a four-year term as Columbus County sheriff in 2014, wants to be seated as sheriff over Greene, whose eligibility for the office and process are contested by claims made in Harris' lawsuit.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;Hatcher received 37 fewer votes than Greene, a hand recount of the November 6 election showed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;But Greene's campaign has had a shadow cast over it by association with a political consulting firm that has come under state scrutiny in the unresolved U.S. congressional election for North Carolina's Ninth District.&amp;nbsp;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;Blanks, on behalf of Hatcher, requests resolution of the state&#x2019;s investigation into the race, as there are four complaints before the State Board of Elections and Ethics Enforcement (SBEEE) relating to it.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;Hatcher's lawsuit alleges that Greene is, by his own admission, a resident of either adjoining Robeson County or Cherry Grove, South Carolina. For eligibility, residence in the county for which the Sheriff's office is sought is required for one year immediately preceding election, as set forth in North Carolina General Statutes.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Despite the fact that no official Certificate of Election had yet been issued, Greene was sworn into office on the morning of December 3 by District Court Judge Ashley Gore during a special session.&amp;nbsp;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;Another issue of contention is the process by which Greene was sworn into office. Public oath-of-office documents hold a signature that is not Gore&#x2019;s, but by rather of North Carolina House Member Brenden Jones, representative for District 46, which covers roughly half of Columbus County as well as part of Robeson County. However, Blanks says Jones &#x201C;cannot attest that [Greene] appeared before him to take the oath.&#x201D; This discontinuity and possible fraud, Blanks argues, renders his status as sheriff &#x201C;void ab initio,&#x201D; or invalid from the outset.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;Hatcher requested an injunction requiring Columbus county officials to recognize him as &#x201C;the true and indeed Constitutional and Statutory Sheriff.&#x201D;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;Hatcher first took the office of Columbus County Sheriff in January of 2014 when he was appointed to the position by Columbus County commissioners upon the resignation of the former sheriff, Chris Batten. Later that same year, a solid majority of his constituents voted to keep Hatcher in the job.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;The 2018 race was much closer, with unofficial results yielding a very narrow 37-vote victory for Greene. But suspicions were raised when finance records revealed the payments made by Greene&#x2019;s campaign to the Red Dome Group, a political consulting firm that has come under scrutiny related to the actions of one of its associates in the race for a U.S. Congressional seat that elected Red Dome client Mark Harris.&amp;nbsp;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;The investigation at first only involved absentee ballot irregularities in nearby Bladen and Robeson Counties. The uncertified sheriff&#x2019;s race in Columbus County was, in late December, pulled into the scope of an SBEEE investigation currently unfolding in North Carolina&#x2019;s Ninth Congressional District.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;One person of interest named in documents released by state investigators is operative and Red Dome associate Leslie McCrae Dowless, who has worked on several campaigns for various state elected offices in North Carolina and was connected to Greene's campaign through the Red Dome Group.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;The Red Dome Group was implicated in the mishandling of 9th District absentee ballots through the reported activities of Dowless.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;The Sundial has attempted to reach Red Dome representatives for comment on multiple occasions, without a response.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;The 2018 campaign of Brenden Jones, who disputes that he signed Greene's oath of office, also engaged Red Dome and participated in its "absentee program," as Jones acknowledged to the Columbus News Reporter.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jones told the News Reporter, "My campaign became aware that Red Dome engaged in an absentee program for several campaigns in the 2018 general election. Concerning my campaign, I contracted with Red Dome to handle my day-to-day operations. Red Dome included an absentee program in my campaign as well, where they would send me notifications of absentee ballot requests that their company monitored so that my campaign could mail campaign literature or call the individual requester.&#x201D;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;Jones defeated Democrat Barbara Yates-Lockamy by the wide margin of 5,357 in the general election.&amp;nbsp;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Wake County District Attorney&#x2019;s office and SBEEE officials are now investigating Dowless&#x2019; get-out-the-vote efforts; specifically accusations that his staffers violated state law by collecting absentee ballots in unsealed envelopes, which could be tampered with.&amp;nbsp;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&#x201C;The question is, were the ballots manipulated? Were they circumvented? Were they never delivered?&#x201D; said Dr. Michael Bitzer, professor of history and political science at Catawba College in Salisbury, N.C.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;Approximately 336 tallied votes in the Hatcher-Greene race were mail-in absentee ballots, according the result breakdown posted to the SBEE website, with 243 of those cast for Hatcher, the remaining 93 going to Greene.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bitzer thinks clarity about all the counties&#x2019; elections will elude us a little longer, &#x201C;until the new state board [of elections] takes power and goes into effect&#x2026;[and] we hear from the [SBEEE] investigators on this particular issue.&#x201D;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;If Greene is found to be illegally performing the office of sheriff, there may be a chance, as alleged in the court filing, that the county would face legal challenges over current searches, seizures and arrests.&lt;br&gt;</body>

    <title>Seeing Flu Outbreak, Hospitals Halt Children Visitors</title>
    <subhead></subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>CHAPEL Hill &#x2014; With influenza taking a heavy toll on North Carolina residents this winter, temporary rules will curtail visits to Triangle-area hospitals by children until the spread of the flu abates.
	
	Starting Friday, January 11, children younger than 11 years old were prohibited from visiting inpatients and any oncology outpatient areas in UNC Rex Hospital in Raleigh. 
	
	On Monday, January 14, UNC Hospitals  in Chapel Hill, Hillsborough and Raleigh and the WakeBrook Behavioral Health Facility (also of UNC Health Care) in Raleigh will follow suit, prohibiting children from visiting inpatients, inpatient waiting rooms and operation waiting rooms.
	
	At the time of publication, Duke University Hospital in Durham, its associated branches and urgent care locations have yet to impose similar visitation rules, though Duke did implement restrictions in February of 2017 and 2018.
	
	According to the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), flu has taken the lives of 16 people so far this season. Last year, a total of 391 flu patients died in North Carolina. 
	
	Six of the 16 deaths tallied by state officials occurred within the last week, prompting UNC to implement the child non-visitation measure; children and the elderly are especially at &#x201C;high risk for serious flu complications,&#x201D; the DHHS &lt;a href="https://flu.nc.gov/" target="_blank"&gt;writes.&lt;/a&gt; 
	
	&#x201C;We understand that visitor restrictions at our hospitals present challenges for families and can be difficult,&#x201D; a UNC Health Care statement &lt;a href="http://news.unchealthcare.org/news/2019/january/unc-hospitals-and-unc-rex-implement-new-visitor-restrictions-due-to-flu" target="_blank"&gt;read.&lt;/a&gt; &#x201C;However, our priority is protecting vulnerable patients as the number of flu cases in the Triangle and statewide continues to increase.&#x201D;
	
	Epidemiologists and other healthcare professionals are encouraging healthy adults to get their flu vaccines, though such shots do not ensure immunity The CDC estimated that the 2017-2018 influenza vaccine provided only 24 percent effectiveness in preventing the most common strains, and were just 40 percent effective against all..
	
	The WakeMed Hospital system has put into effect a similar plan, with an age restriction for visitors set at 12 years old. WakeMed has also banned all non-patients displaying flu-like symptoms such as vomiting, severe cough and diarrhea. 
	
	The flu fact sheet &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/disease/spread.htm" target="_blank"&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; on the official CDC website explains that the life cycle of most flu strains has a contagious period lasting for approximately one week, starting one day prior to symptom development. A caveat to this claim states that &#x201C;some people can be infected with the flu virus but have no symptoms. During this time, those people may still spread the virus to others.&#x201D;
	
	In most cases, skin-to-skin contact is not enough to pass the disease to another person; the flu virus must reach the bloodstream via mucus membrane, typically in one&#x2019;s eye, nose, mouth or other body cavity. Most strains can persist for up to two days on the outside of a host body if on a nonporous surface, which, if touched, can unknowingly transmit the virus hand-to-mouth or hand-to-eye. (The survival time is shorter for porous surfaces.)
	
	In UNC Health Care&#x2019;s press release, those &#x201C;would-be visitors affected by the restrictions&#x201D; are encouraged &#x201C;to write letters or emails to the patients,&#x201D; rather than risk the infection or transmission. </body>

    <title>With Removal of Silent Sam's Pedestal, UNC's Chancellor Throws a Curveball and Takes a Bow</title>
    <subhead></subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>CHAPEL HILL &#x2014; Carol Folt, chancellor of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill,  announced her abrupt resignation on Monday, the same day she ordered the removal of the pedestal upon which the Confederate effigy &#x201C;Silent Sam&#x201D; had stood for over a century, and which stood bare upon the north quad since protestors pulled the statue down on August 20. 
	
	The pedestal's removal was completed before the start of business the next morning. By 2 AM Tuesday, January 15, workers had used a crane to hoist the slab of stone and haul it on a flatbed truck from McCorkle Place, to be preserved elsewhere until a decision is made as to its fate. 
	
	The pedestal consists of the stone plinth and three tablets, one of which reads, &#x201C;To the sons of the university who entered the War of 1861&#x2013;65 in answer to the call of their country and whose lives taught the lesson of their great commander that duty is the sublimest word in the English language,&#x201D; referencing a quotation disputedly attributed to Confederate General Robert E. Lee, &#x201C;Duty, then, is the sublimest word in our language.&#x201D;
	
	Folt has served as chancellor since July of 2013. Her tenure as leader of the nation's oldest public university became snarled in the controversy and politics that flared around Silent Sam, which flared after the protests and counterprotests in Charlottesville, Va., surrounding the planned removal of a statue of General Lee in August of 2017.
	
	Tuesday afternoon, in a closed session meeting, the UNC Board of Governors ordered Folt, who had planned to stay in her position through May, to vacate her post by the end of the month.
	
	&#x201C;As chancellor, the safety of the UNC-Chapel Hill community is my clear, unequivocal and non-negotiable responsibility,&#x201D; Folt wrote in a press release  that circulated Monday. &#x201C;The presence of the remaining parts of the monument on campus poses a continuing threat both to the personal safety and well-being of our community and to our ability to provide a stable, productive educational environment."
	
	Folt's statement added, &#x201C;No one learns at their best when they feel unsafe.&#x201D; 
	
	Harry Smith, chairman of the Board of Governors, told the News &amp;amp; Observer on Tuesday, &#x201C;We feel strongly that it&#x2019;s probably in the best interest to go ahead and allow a change in leadership so we can move to a healing process&#x2026;[and] allow the institution to move forward. So that&#x2019;s why we compressed the timeline.&#x201D; He called the deconstruction &#x201C;a draconian action.&#x201D;
	
	He said the decision to quicken her departure is not a punishment for Folt. However, on Monday, before the decision was made, Smith said Folt&#x2019;s announcement &#x201C;undermines and insults the Board&#x2019;s goal to operate with class and dignity.&#x201D;
	
	For its part, the UNC-Chapel Hill Board of Trustees  issued a statement backing Folt&#x2019;s decision on Monday, stating, &#x201C;The chancellor has ultimate authority over campus public safety, and we agree Chancellor Folt is acting properly to preserve campus security.&#x201D;
	
	The Board of Trustees advises the Board of Governors about UNC-Chapel Hill, one member of the statewide University of North Carolina system that the Board of Governors oversees. The Board of Trustees includes the UNC-Chapel Hill student president, four appointees of the General Assembly and eight appointees of the Board of Governors.
	
	&#x201C;Carolina has been well served by its 11th chancellor. We will continue to work closely with Chancellor Folt and the UNC System to ensure a smooth leadership transition,&#x201D; the Board of Trustees wrote.
	
	Governor Roy Cooper weighed in Tuesday morning with a vote of confidence for Folt, stating, &#x201C;I appreciate the Chancellor&#x2019;s actions to keep students and the public safe. North Carolina is welcoming to all, and our public university should reflect that.&#x201D;
	
	In a campus-wide email addressing the situation, Folt bade students, faculty and staff a bittersweet goodbye. &#x201C;While I recognize that some may not agree with my decision to remove the base and tablets now,&#x201D; she wrote, &#x201C;I am confident this is the right one for our community."
	
	&#x201C;Carolina is better positioned than ever to be the &#x2018;university of and for the people,&#x2019;&#x201D; said Folt, referencing the country&#x2019;s oldest university&#x2019;s mission. &#x201C;I believe Carolina&#x2019;s next chancellor will be well placed to build on our momentum.&#x201D;
	
	At 8 PM Tuesday, nearly 100 students and activists converged in celebration on Franklin Street&#x2019;s Peace and Justice Plaza, across from Sam&#x2019;s former site, for music, food and speakers. Those present included Carrboro&#x2013;Chapel Hill NAACP Chapter President Anna Richards and UNC Assistant Professor Dwayne Dixon. Dixon made headlines in November 2018 when a right-wing blogger filed assault charges against him after an altercation at a counter-protest in McCorkle Place. The charges were later dropped.
	
	In 2015, the North Carolina Historical Commission was granted oversight of requested monument relocation by the General Assembly, giving 11 professional and amateur historians the final say on the fate of all statues and memorials located public property.
	
	The Board of Trustees, however, have supported Folt&#x2019;s unilateral decision as made on firm legal grounds as the 2015 law stipulates a public safety exception. They agree with Folt&#x2019;s words: &#x201C;Nothing is more important than keeping our campus community and visitors as safe as possible.&#x201D; 
	
	William Roper, who became the interim UNC system president on January 1, is beginning the search for an interim chancellor replacing Folt, according to Board of Governors chairman Harry Smith.</body>

    <title>Wake County Schools Ditch Lunch Trays</title>
    <subhead></subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>RALEIGH &#x2014; Wake County&#x2019;s 187 public schools are abandoning the use of disposable polystyrene lunch trays in favor of 100-percent recycled molded fiber, a biodegradable material typically made from paperboard and newsprint pulp, in an effort to address environmental and health concerns associated with petroleum-based products.
	
	Polystyrene, better known to many by the popular trade name Styrofoam, is a thermoplastic polymer developed in the 1830s by manipulating resin extracted from the American sweetgum tree. A highly inert compound, it is resistant to both bio- and photodegradation, taking hundreds of years to break down naturally. 
	
	The decision was made by the Wake County Public School System&#x2019;s Child Nutrition Department. Communication director Lisa Luten told the Sundial, &#x201C;The fiber trays are more expensive than the previous trays. The cost of the old trays were 3.49 cents [per tray], cost of the new trays are 6.13 cents.
	
	&#x201C;The Child Nutrition Department is required by law to be self-sustaining so in order for them to afford the more expensive trays they renegotiated on a recycling contract for kitchen plastics and metals&#x2026;and that helped free up resources to help offset the added cost,&#x201D; Luten said.
	
	Sue Scoop, spokesperson for the pro-compostable-trays advocacy group Every Tray Counts, said &#x201C;most adults remember reusable trays&#x201D; from their childhood, made from metal or hard plastic and washed after every meal, &#x201C;and they think that is still what is happening. 
	
	&#x201C;But most schools, it turns out, don&#x2019;t have the infrastructure to do that anymore... They either don&#x2019;t have the proper plumbing or capital investment for the dishwasher or they won&#x2019;t pay for the labor,&#x201D; Scoop said. &#x201C;So they move to cheap disposable trays, which are dangerous for the environment and for children.&#x201D;
	
	The Every Tray Counts website cites concerns over cancer-risk ingredients of styrene and benzene leaking out into food on lunch trays, especially when the food is fatty and/or hot, or the tray is scraped.&amp;nbsp;
	
	&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); display: inline; float: none; font-family: &amp;amp;quot;open-sans&amp;amp;quot;,serif; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-justify: auto; text-transform: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;"&gt;The International Agency for Research on Cancer classifies polysterene, as &#x201C;not classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to humans,&#x201D; and styrene as &#x201C;probably carcinogenic to humans,&#x201D; a recent upgrade in severity.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;strike&gt;&lt;/strike&gt;&lt;br&gt;
	
	Though there are reported neurotoxic effects, such as headaches and drowsiness, from high exposures to polystyrene&#x2019;s ingredient of styrene, food wrapping and food contact items don&#x2019;t deliver a high enough exposure to cause concern, according to a comprehensive &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12012775" target="_blank"&gt;review &lt;/a&gt; of the relevant literature conducted by experts with the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis in 2002. It concluded there &#x201C;does not appear to be a strong causal correlation between styrene and increased human cancer incidence.&#x201D;&lt;br&gt;
	
	Government-level efforts to reduce polystyrene use and production in the United States date back to 1987 when Berkeley, California, passed an initiative banning traditional Styrofoam as a component of food containers. Suffolk County, New York was the first jurisdiction to attempt a complete polystyrene ban in 1988, but this endeavor proved unsuccessful in the face of the plastics lobby and other industrial trade groups. By the mid-2000s, more than a hundred local districts had at least minimally restricted polystyrene.
	
	The cost benefit of polystyrene products from a budget perspective is their extremely low manufacturing costs, but Scoop says this can be offset if school districts also implement Every Tray Counts&#x2019; suggested composting plan.&#x201D;
	
	Wake County has not announced if or when they would begin to compost, or if they would encourage schools to do so.
	
	Scoop said, &#x201C;It has to be stressed that the cost becomes neutral or beneficial if you institute the whole program... You&#x2019;re now shifting the extra cost of the trays by reducing trash dumpsters, trash pick-up and landfill costs.
	
	&#x201C;I think that&#x2019;s really important because, once people hear that [molded fiber] trays cost more, that becomes a huge hurdle.&#x201D;
	
	For now, the county&#x2019;s students will be throwing out around 53,000 fewer polystyrene trays every day.</body>

    <title>NC Chief Justice Announces Retirement, Gov. Cooper to Fill Spot</title>
    <subhead></subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>RALEIGH &#x2014; Governor Roy Cooper will be handed the opportunity of reshaping North Carolina&#x2019;s highest court following Chief Justice Mark Martin&#x2019;s announcement on Friday, January 25 that he that he would be retiring as soon as February, before the completion of his term.
	
	&#x201C;I will forever cherish the memories of serving with so many amazing and capable people,&#x201D; said Martin in a written statement released to media. After taking a seat on the Supreme Court in  1999, and spending his last five years as chief justice, Martin&#x2019;s announcement said he has chosen to &#x201C;direct my focus to helping prepare the next generation of leaders.&#x201D; In this pursuit, Martin has accepted employment as dean of the law school at Regent University, a private Christian research institute in Virginia.
	
	Governor Cooper addressed Martin&#x2019;s decision on social media Friday afternoon, posting on his official Facebook account, &#x201C;I appreciate Chief Justice Mark Martin&#x2019;s service to the state and the judiciary and his efforts to strengthen our court system.&#x201D;
	
	&#x201C;Leading the state&#x2019;s highest court and its court system is a critically important job,&#x201D; the governor&#x2019;s statement continued. &#x201C;I will carefully consider his replacement in the coming days."
	
	For well over a century, associate justice positions on the N.C. Supreme Court have been elected to eight-year terms by popular vote. In 2002, the state passed a law stripping partisan labels from all judicial election ballots. However, the General Assembly replaced the law in 2016 to restore the labels. Of the seven current Supreme Court justices, only two are registered Republicans, and Martin is one of them. Governor Cooper is not obligated to fill the vacancy from the ranks of the GOP and therefore there may be only a single conservative serving on the N.C. Supreme Court.
	
	State Republicans commanded a 4-3 majority on the court until the 2016 general election when Democrat Mike Morgan defeated incumbent Bob Edmunds. Democrat Anita Earles then won her seat from Republican Barbara Jackson during the 2018 midterms. 
	
	Martin was nothing if not precocious in his early days on the bench. At the age of 29, he was the youngest judge to serve on the state Superior Court since the late 18th century. Two years later, he became the youngest person in history to take an N.C. Court of Appeals position. 
	
	Winning a state supreme court seat in 1998 at the age of 35 not only broke another record for relative youth, but gave Martin time to develop his thoughtful approaches to complex civil and criminal disputes.
	
	Martin&#x2019;s opinion in the 2001 Bacon v. Lee case ruled that any governor who once served as attorney general cannot be prevented from considering the clemency petitions filed by death row inmates.
	
	In 2017, Martin supported efforts to phase out the statewide practice of charging juvenile offenders as adults; his public endorsement of the &#x201C;Raise the Age&#x201D; Bill was instrumental in building the bipartisan coalition which prevailed in its passage.
	
	Martin was selected in 2011 to join the prestigious Warren E. Burger Society, an organization whose membership is limited to those &#x201C;who have demonstrated an exemplary commitment to improving the administration of justice through extraordinary contributions of service,&#x201D; according to the National Center for State Courts website.</body>

    <subhead>Parking and construction schedule listed as concerns</subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>CARRBORO &#x2014; The ArtsCenter, an educational public arts classroom and performance venue that serves as a hub to the town's performance and arts education life, has pulled out of a multi-use project slated for development by the Town of Carrboro.
	
	Nearly nine months after the Carrboro Board of Aldermen approved what has become known as the 203 Project &#x2014; a library building, concert venue and cultural center the Sundial &lt;a href="https://piedmontsundial.com/calendar/calendar_main_article.php?theArticle=212" target="_blank"&gt;previously reported on&lt;/a&gt; &#x2014; the development (which has yet to break ground) has lost one of its stakeholders in the ArtsCenter. The ArtsCenter is currently situated at 300 East Main Street, in a plaza whose recent development includes a hotel and the area branded as "East Main Square."
	
	The 203 Project building is planned to include not only the Orange County Library Southern Branch, but also Carrboro&#x2019;s Recreation and Parks offices, a teen center, a virtual justice center (associated with NC Central University&#x2019;s Virtual Justice Project, offering online pre-law and legal information classes) and the local radio station WCOM (the station currently broadcasts from a station located at 300 East Main Street).
	
	The project's development is approved on town-owned land at the southeast corner of Roberson Street and South Greensboro Street, over what is currently a paved lot offering 88 unmetered parking spots and an additional 12 unmarked parking spaces along the street.
	
	The ArtsCenter&#x2019;s marketing director, Patrick Phelphs-McKeown, said the decision came &#x201C;after much consideration&#x201D; in a press release on January 15. The ArtsCenter cited scheduling issues as well as other concerns, including parking, a problem looming over the town as a whole as well as this municipal project.
	
	The same ArtsCenter statement quotes executive director Dan Mayer saying, &#x201C;Over the years, the Town of Carrboro has built a close professional relationship with The ArtsCenter, and although The ArtsCenter has chosen to not participate in this project, we look forward to continuing to build that relationship and working together on future collaborations.&#x201D;
	
	The ArtsCenter is still planning to move from East Main Square, where it owns its building. Mayer, who spoke to the Sundial by phone, said, "The town is trying to resolve how much parking to build, where to build parking, who pays for the parking, how much parking will be needed for the building itself. All that discussion is taking time, and we are on a faster timetable   than they are&#x2026; We're hoping to open [our own new facility] in three to four years,&#x201D; and the town may not make that timeline. Construction may not begin till 2020.
	
	&#x201C;We needed to take charge of this on our own,&#x201D; said Mayer said. Development of the 203 Project parking will be complex, "and our parking needs are much simpler."
	
	The 203 Project will replace municipal parking at the intersection of South Greensboro Street and West Weaver Street, across from Open Eye Caf&#xE9;. While current construction schematics do indicate that at least some on-site parking will be provided, both at ground level and below, parking consultant Ian Banks of the Nelson\Nygaard civil planning firm told the Sundial that the exact number of spots the project will include has yet to be determined: &#x201C;That&#x2019;s still part of the architectural process and will be baked into the final design of the building.&#x201D;
	
	When the exact blueprint is settled on, including parking spots, it will be presented to the Board again. In September of 2018, the firm Perkins+Will Global submitted three basic designs, and, after public input meetings, &#x201C;The Commons&#x201D; was chosen. The building will therefore be three floors and 45,000 square feet, with the library on the second floor.
	
	The parking plan presented to the Carrboro Board of Aldermen by Nelson\Nygaard representatives in October of 2018 only specified how the issue will be accommodated during the construction process. One agenda document from the presentation states, &#x201C;The goal will be to provide spaces that are open and easily identifiable to the customers of the downtown.&#x201D;
	
	The document continues, &#x201C;A key strategy in doing this will be to move employees, park and ride, or other longer-term parking out of core downtown lots including , Century Center, Armadillo [Grill], and Jean Ward&#x2019;s lot,&#x201D; which is attached to Carolyn Jean Ward&#x2019;s office for realty on 111 Cheek Street. &#x201C;Implementation of this plan will require participation on everyone&#x2019;s part.&#x201D;
	
	Carrboro is the most population-dense municipality in the state, and the town population is not expected to decrease. Parking at key private businesses in the town center, such as Carr Mill Mall and Weaver Street Market, have already been approached by town officials for permission to use their available parking during off hours. Fitch Lumber Company on North Greensboro Street and Piedmont Healthcare on Lloyd Street have already agreed to allow parking after business hours and on the weekend. The CVS by Carr Mill will be approached after a new owner arrives, one who will already be talking about shared and leased parking options with private lot owners. 
	
	&#x201C;At this stage, I don&#x2019;t think anything is off the table,&#x201D; Banks said by phone. &#x201C;The town realizes that there isn&#x2019;t one silver bullet that will provide parking; there&#x2019;s going to be a number of different strategies.&#x201D; </body>

    <title>Wake Schools to Mull Progressive Dress Code Language</title>
    <subhead>Gender-specific language to be scrubbed from new policy</subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>CARY &#x2014; Students attending Wake County public schools may soon find their daily wardrobe options expanded and less gender-specific if the Wake County Board of Education approves changes to the Student Code of Conduct as presented by the system&#x2019;s policy committee at a meeting held Tuesday, January 29.
	
	The policy committee will also review key punitive provisions in the Student Code and consider reducing penalties for lower-level offenses such as insubordination or plagiarism by introducing &#x201C;restorative discipline,&#x201D; a holistic approach to &#x201C;addressing student behavior that fosters belonging over exclusion, social engagement over control, and meaningful accountability over punishment,&#x201D; according to the Institute for Restorative Justice and Restorative Dialogue.
	
	The institute gives examples of school usage that includes taking turns in circles to build community or address harms, holding conferences, fostering dialogue and allowing students to problem-solve their own issues in school and with others.
	
	Another potential change under consideration could limit the practice of in-school suspension, asking principals to first attempt &#x201C;non-disciplinary interventions.&#x201D;
	
	If the suggestions discussed Tuesday with regard to students&#x2019; dress code ultimately win approval, Wake students will be required to wear &#x201C;a shirt with pants or skirt, or the equivalent (for example dresses, leggings, or shorts and shoes).&#x201D;
	
	Both the tops and bottoms of a given outfit must have &#x201C;fabric on the front and sides....and must not be transparent.&#x201D; All clothing will also be expected to cover undergarments, but the proposed new rules would permit strapless or spaghetti strap shirts, so-called short shorts and tops exposing a bare midriff.
	
	Some specific fashion choices will remain verboten, such as clothes with words or illustrations referencing drugs or alcohol, or using profane language; and spiked jewelry.
	
	&#x201C;We&#x2019;re not going to allow students to dress in a way that would not be safe for school,&#x201D; said Kathryn Chontos, interim assistant superintendent for the school system&#x2019;s student services. &#x201C;We&#x2019;re not going to allow just anything.&#x201D;
	
	Any article of clothing displaying bigoted or hateful speech will also remain on the list of banned items. Although this specific prohibition is not part of the dress code proper, but is listed as part of the broader harassment and bullying provisions of the Wake County Public School System (WCPSS) Student Code of Conduct. 
	
	Hate speech remains a nebulous category as cultural attitudes shift over time. In August of 2017 the Orange County school system changed its own policies to disallow clothes bearing Confederate iconography. Wake County, however, has yet to take the same steps. 
	
	WCPSS' current dress code policy, implemented in 2002, explicitly forbids 11 specific categories of clothing. Challenges arose to the current rule book's across-the-board ban on head coverings and its prohibition of &#x201C;excessively short, tight or revealing clothes.&#x201D;
	
	Wake school principals are currently granted a fair amount autonomy in dress code enforcement, such as having medical conditions that make compliance difficult. They are allowed to make exceptions for students in unique circumstances, and they are also free to ban new problematic clothing at their schools, such as a type of item that causes distractions. However, the board is still allowed to challenge such a ban.
	
	School board members have asked administrative officials to base revisions on the student code developed in the Portland, Oregon, school system, which uses gender-neutral language in its prohibitive descriptions. A similar policy was recently adopted in Seattle, and Washington, D.C., public schools have publicly broached the topic by allowing their own dress code to be studied by education scholars.
	
	"The classic implementation of the dress code does unfairly target women," said School Board Chairman Jim Martin at the meeting.
	
	Torrie Edwards, a doctoral candidate at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill currently working on a dissertation about dress code policy, anticipates much of the resistance to this change to come from &#x201C;an older generation that grew up when clothing expectations were different.&#x201D;
	
	&#x201C;Students should be free from the expectation that they are responsible for other people&#x2019;s behavior," Edwards believes, such as in cases of so-called distracting clothing.
	
	Different views about the purpose of schools sway people&#x2019;s opinions about dress code: &#x201C;People who resist this often see school as creating people who can survive in a professional environment,&#x201D; she said, &#x201C;Whereas I look at schools and see value in personal expression and personal liberty.&#x201D;</body>

    <title>Stalled 9th District Congress Election Has Hearing Set</title>
    <subhead></subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>RALEIGH &#x2014; The North Carolina State Board of Elections announced Monday, February 4 that in two weeks there will be the first, possibly only, hearing into the available evidence of &lt;a href="https://piedmontsundial.com/calendar/calendar_main_article.php?theArticle=216" target="_blank"&gt;election fraud&lt;/a&gt; in North Carolina&#x2019;s 9th Congressional District race between Republican Mark Harris and Democrat Dan McCready.
	
	Also under investigation are &#x201C;three local contests in Bladen and Robeson counties,&#x201D; seat 2 on the District Court of Judicial District 16B, Bladen County Commissioner for District 3 and Bladen Soil and Water Conservation District Supervisor. 
	
	Set for 10 AM Monday, February 18, the hearing will be open to the public at 217 East Edenton Street in Raleigh at the North Carolina State Bar. According to the press release, the hearing is &#x201C;expected to conclude within two days, but the State Board has reserved the site from February 18-20.
	
	&#x201C;Seating is limited,&#x201D; the press release continued, &#x201C;but the hearing likely will be live-streamed.&#x201D;
	
	Appointed less than a week ago by Democratic Governor Roy Cooper, the five-member board will examine allegations of absentee voting irregularities in a race in which Harris currently leads McCready by 905 votes, though the results remain unofficial and uncertified. 
	
	The previous nine-member Board of Elections had originally scheduled the evidentiary hearing for a date in January, but a three-judge panel ordered it dissolved on December 28, 2018 based on an October ruling that its makeup was unconstitutional, mostly on grounds of limiting the governor&#x2019;s power over members.
	
	In late January, attorneys for Harris asked Wake County Superior Court Judge Paul Ridgeway to certify the election results without regard to the ongoing investigation. Ridgeway denied Harris&#x2019; request.
	
	On February 7, the Board will meet to discuss other topics but will allot some of that time to an executive session during which staffers will brief board members on each investigatory point to be presented at the evidentiary hearing. 
	
	The new Board of Elections Chairman Bob Cordle told the Charlotte Observer that a vote will be held at the conclusion of the hearing.
	
	The Board consists of three Democrats and two Republicans with current procedural rules stating that three votes can certify an election and four can call for a new election.
	
	North Carolina&#x2019;s 9th District remains unrepresented in the United States Congress until a candidate is certified.</body>

    <title>State DMV May Move to Rocky Mount, But Raleigh HQ Workers Object</title>
    <subhead></subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>RALEIGH &#x2014; The North Carolina Council of State, a group of 10 high-ranking executive branch officials, has delayed voting on a proposed move of the North Carolina Department of Motor Vehicles headquarters from Raleigh to Rocky Mount.
	
	Submitting to pressure from members of the State Employee Association (SEA) and state representatives for Wake County, the council agreed on Tuesday, February 5, to delay for a month the vote on possible relocation of the agency&#x2019;s headquarters to a location in Rocky Mount, 55 driving miles from its present downtown Raleigh location. 
	
	The move would affect most of the approximately 600 workers at the state agency, which is a division of the North Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT).
	
	Asbestos and additional safety risks yet unspecified at the location on New Bern Avenue caused this move. DMV workers must vacate the agency&#x2019;s current premises by October of 2020 and transfer its day-to-day operations somewhere else in Wake or a bordering county, by order of a state budget bill passed in May of 2018.
	
	According to a statement sent to media on Monday, February 4 by the NCDOT, &#x201C;Should the Council of State vote to accept this bid, the N.C. General Assembly will be asked to allocate funding for the move.&#x201D;
	
	All 16 of Wake County&#x2019;s representatives in the General Assembly oppose the idea of moving DMV&#x2019;s headquarters to Rocky Mount. Other representatives, such as House Speaker Tim Moore, support the move.
	
	&#x201C;We did a review and looked for the most cost-effective locations with our specifications and after the open bidding process,&#x201D; said Jamie Kritzer, communications director for the North Carolina Department of Transportation; &#x201C;The Rocky Mount location...was identified as the most competitive bid.&#x201D; 
	
	State law requires accepting the lowest qualifying offer, Kritzer said.
	
	Of the 12 proposals brought by Triangle-based developers, the site which once housed the corporate offices of fast food giant Hardee&#x2019;s (and more recently, Centura Bank and RBC Bank) offered the lowest rent while meeting all the department&#x2019;s spatial and IT requirements. 
	
	The lease offered for the proposed Rocky Mount site would cost the state over $2 million annually.
	
	While it may have been sufficiently vetted for financial and architectural concerns, the logistics of transferring an entire team of specialized government workers with lives rooted in the capital are proving complicated. Employees who keep their jobs would either have to move or adjust to a much longer commute.
	
	It was these concerns, expressed at a town-hall-style forum the evening of Monday, February 4 that was organized by SEA staffers for DMV employees affected by the move, that convinced Council members including Governor Roy Cooper to pause the process. 
	
	Not all employees stationed at the New Bern Avenue headquarters will be willing to stay on board through the move, raising the total cost of the endeavor to include new hires and their training.
	
	When asked if the cost of training new DMV workers to replace those leaving figured into their budget plan, Kritzer did not answer, responding rather, &#x201C;The bottom line is we have been given a legislative mandate, and we can&#x2019;t break the law.
	
	&#x201C;We are not in the business of convincing people of one thing or another,&#x201D; Kritzer said, referring to convincing DMV workers to move or stay. Although, he added, &#x201C;We are not insensitive to what DMV employees are going through.&#x201D;
	
	So what happens if the majority of the council members vote no on the cheapest offer, that of Rocky Mount &#x2014; are they in violation of the law? &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know the answer to that,&#x201D; Kritzer said. He added that approving a different bid would require justification to the General Assembly and its budget office &#x201C;that [the new location] is the most prudent use of taxpayer money.&#x201D; 
	
	The Council of State consists of the highest executive offices in the state, including North Carolina&#x2019;s governor and lieutenant governor, as well as secretary of state, auditor, treasurer, superintendent of public instruction, attorney general, commissioner of agriculture, commissioner of labor and commissioner of insurance. All members hold popularly elected office at the state level.</body>

    <title>Carrboro LGBTQ+ Community Lays Groundwork for a Center</title>
    <subhead></subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>CARRBORO &#x2014; A group of advocates in Carrboro has begun working to establish a community space for LGBTQ members of the town, a reaction to the Trump administration's efforts to roll back equality and protection for some Americans.
	
	When hatred rears its ugly head, love always wins. This is what a handful of individuals in Carrboro held to be true when they decided to organize and help protect LGBTQIA+ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex, asexual and more) community members.
	
	&#x201C;After Trump was elected, friends and colleagues were feeling a lot of fear for their safety,&#x201D; said Christy Croft with the LGBTQ Center of Carrboro, which seeks to establish a center in the town. &#x201C;So, we began organizing to create a safe space somewhere that people could come once a month and be themselves.&#x201D;
	
	Though the LGBTQ Center of Carrboro uses just those five letters in its name, its website promises support of LGBTQIA+ folks.
	
	There have been several moves by the president and those he directs to roll back protections &#x2014; often Obama-era ones &#x2014; for transgender and non-heterosexual groups: in 2017, there was the ban on transgender people serving in the military (upheld by the Supreme Court) and a friend-of-the-court brief by the Justice Department claiming that the Civil Rights Act of 1964 does not criminalize discrimination based on sexual orientation; in 2018, there was another friend-of-the-court brief supporting a baker refusing to make two men a wedding cake (upheld by the Supreme Court) and the administration&#x2019;s consideration of defining gender by genitalia at birth only, which would erase federal civil rights protection of transsexual people.
	
	Around the election, queer family dinners (QFDs), a family-style dinner organized in private homes for LGBTQ community members, began popping up all over the United States, including in Carrboro, where they flourished.
	
	&#x201C;QFD is a potluck in someone's home. And we found at these events that some of the young people were couch surfing and often estranged from their families,&#x201D; Croft said. &#x201C;QFD gave them a family that they might not otherwise have.&#x201D;
	
	After much interest, &#x201C;We moved our QFD to a larger, more accessible place. August was our first big and open QFD at Pacifica common room in Carrboro,&#x201D; said Croft. Pacifica is a cohousing community. &#x201C;On the first night, we had over 50 people.&#x201D;
	
	Several volunteers in Carrboro organized the QFDs, and during them, they started to see a lot of homelessness among queer youth. Croft and others began seeking ways to put an end to it.
	
	&#x201C;We met with the Durham LGBTQ Center and bounced off ideas with them,&#x201D; said Croft. &#x201C;They were very supportive and told us that we were a handful of people and that in order to accomplish a center, we needed a whole community behind us.&#x201D;
	
	The center in Carrboro will be modeled after both the Charlotte and Durham LGBTQ Centers. Members of the Carrboro group refer to Charlotte&#x2019;s Time Out Youth Center as the "gold standard."
	
	The &lt;a href="timeoutyouth.org" target="_blank"&gt;Time Out Youth Center&lt;/a&gt; provides emergency financial assistance, emergency housing, host and foster programs for homeless LGBTQ youths, a drop-in space, school and community outreach, a cyber library, online chat space, discussion groups, a &#x201C;time out&#x201D; space for people from ages 11 to 20, and individual counseling.
	
	The &lt;a href="lgbtqcenterofdurham.org" target="_blank"&gt;LGBTQ Center of Durham&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;has community support with medical, educational, mental health, addiction recovery, legal and tax services, to name a few. Their future goals include a safe and inclusive drop-in space, a library, community resource directory, youth, elder and family programs, support groups, HIV and STI testing, referrals to social services, phone helplines, social events and further community outreach programs.
	
	Durham has a foster program for 18-to-25-year-olds from within the LGBTQ community that provides a safe and queer-friendly home for displaced youths. It became a long-term goal for the organizers of the future LGBTQ Center of Carrboro.&lt;br&gt;
	
	The 10 central volunteers are in touch with a growing community that includes parents, homeless people and local government &#x2014; Mayor Lydia Lavelle and Alderman Damon Seils have attended events in the past in their official capacity. 
	
	The community is just beginning to lay the groundwork for what could become an institution with &#x201C;pride,&#x201D; offering drop-in support and programs.
	
	No building has yet been secured, nor is there an official nonprofit organization in place. Getting a building may be two or three years down the road, organizers say.
	
	When queer family dinners first started, it was in the home of volunteers Liz Giodano and Aidan Malsbary. The potlucks were monthly for the first six months, and then they switched to twice a month.&lt;br&gt;
	
	&#x201C;It was hard after a while to host and cook for a large group every other week,&#x201D; said Giodano. &#x201C;So, it was nice when it moved to a bigger venue. We wanted to provide healthy meals for our queer and especially trans friends who were often experiencing lack of housing and food insecurity, so we are working on starting a nonprofit 501(c)(3) to create a safe space where they can come and rest and be greeted by their proper pronouns.&#x201D; Status as a 501(c)(3) allows a charitable organization to claim tax exemption from the IRS.
	
	Sometimes emotional support can be found in the smaller things.
	
	&#x201C;We do different things, like Queer Prom or game night, but sometimes it is just simply sitting around a fire and talking,&#x201D; said Croft.
	
	The local concern for the trans community is well grounded in national statistics. In the general population, the suicide attempt rate is 4.6 percent. The suicide attempt rate among transgender and gender nonconforming people is 41 percent. Within that population, the risk was greater for young adults (18 to 24), multiracial and Native American people, and those with lower levels of educational attainment and/or income. This is according to &lt;a href="https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/AFSP-Williams-Suicide-Report-Final.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;analyzed data&lt;/a&gt; from a national survey by the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, with over six thousand respondents.
	
	The group has also organized other support and social groups in the Carrboro area.
	
	&#x201C;We follow a meet-up model and have transmasculine socials and bi/pansexual meet-ups,&#x201D; said Giodano. Their website also advertises Queer Ride Carrboro, a monthly group bike ride open to the Triangle&#x2019;s LGBTQ folks.
	
	Malsbary pointed out that the transmasculine socials helped bring together trans people who are certain of their masculinity &#x2014; trans men, and nonbinary or genderqueer people (outside the woman-man binary) who identify as masculine &#x2014; with people who are questioning, while having dinners, game nights and even s&#x2019;mores.
	
	&#x201C;The intergenerational aspect of it really feels special,&#x201D; Croft said. &#x201C;There has always been a LGBTQ community here, but they used to stick to their peers. We really became a family and we love it.
	
	&#x201C;The community has really spread by word of mouth and Facebook,&#x201D; Malsbary said. &#x201C;There has been progress both here and nationally: Progress in the military, but there was a backlash. And progress here at UNC. In our community this year, UNC started a gender clinic to help with letters for top surgery [breast reduction or removal related to gender confirmation], hormones and therapy.&#x201D;
	
	For example, &#x201C;If you have a six-year-old transgender child, you can take them to the clinic to talk to a professional.&#x201D;
	
	Right now, the 10 central volunteers for the center are working on establishing a 501(c)(3). After achieving that status, they can then begin grant writing, fundraising and receiving donations. Once all is in order, they will begin to seek out a location.

    <title>Davie Poplar Fire-Setter Found Not Guilty by Reason of Insanity</title>
    <subhead></subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>HILLSBOROUGH &#x2014; The man charged with six felony counts in connection with the detonation of a makeshift explosive device on the UNC-Chapel Hill campus, injuring a professor and damaging the iconic Davie Poplar Tree, was found not guilty by reason of insanity in a ruling made Wednesday, February 13.
	
	On November 2, 2017, Joshua Daniel Edwards lit both a backpack and guitar on fire by the base of the historic tree, a university landmark more than three hundred years old, before walking away. UNC astrophysicist Dan Reichart attempted to extinguish the blaze by stomping on the bag, when a fuel cannister detonated. The aftermath left Reichart with moderate to severe burns on his face and arms. 
	
	Charges against Edwards included the use of explosives to inflict injury, the use of explosives to damage property, assembly of a &#x201C;weapon of mass destruction,&#x201D; illegal scorching of grassland, assault with a deadly weapon inflicting serious injury and falsifying a police report. 
	
	Believed to be more than three centuries old, the tulip-flowering Davie Poplar is named for a general in the American Revolution, William Richardson Davie, who helped found UNC, America&#x2019;s first public university, in 1789.
	
	One month after his arrest, an Orange County judge agreed to release Edwards into the custody of a parent after a written agreement signed by Edwards, his father and the state that compelled mental health treatment until the case was resolved.
	
	Based on the complementary conclusions of both the defense and the state&#x2019;s forensic psychiatric evaluations that he currently suffers from an illness known as schizoaffective disorder, Edwards has been involuntarily committed to Central Regional Hospital in Butner. 
	
	According to the criteria laid out in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fifth Edition), schizoaffective disorder is categorized as a mood disorder with symptoms that can include delusional behavior, hallucinations, disorganized speech and anhedonia (loss of the capacity to experience pleasure). 
	
	&#x201C;Both his expert and our expert made reports offering the opinion that he was legally insane,&#x201D; Assistant District Attorney Jeff Neiman told reporters with WRAL, adding that Edwards was &#x201C;not capable of understanding the nature and seriousness of his offense."
	
	&#x201C;It is my genuine hope and desire that Mr. Edwards continues to receive the help and care that he needs, and is supported by a community as I was,&#x201D; Reichart wrote in a statement released to media.
	
	 &#x201C;I was fortunate that day,&#x201D; Reichart&#x2019;swritten statement. &#x201C;The explosion was shrapnel-free. My glasses protected my eyes and probably saved my sight.&#x201D;
	
	After Edwards was initially taken into custody by campus police officers, he lied to investigators, claiming that a second incendiary device was located somewhere in downtown Carrboro. Law enforcement evacuated several town blocks until officials determined the threat to be false.
	
	Edwards will receive treatment in Butner until the court and psychiatrists decide he is not a danger to others or himself.</body>

    <title>State Board Calls for New Congressional Election After GOP Candidate Tied to Fraud</title>
    <subhead></subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>All five members of the North Carolina State Board of Elections on Thursday, February 21 voted to call for a new election in the state&#x2019;s 9th Congressional District after Republican candidate Mark Harris&#x2019; surprising request for one made at the board&#x2019;s hearing. The agreement ended the stand-off for certification of Harris&#x2019; contested win against Democrat Dan McCready.
	
	&#x201C;I believe a new election should be called,&#x201D; Harris said on the third day of the hearings, which were called by the Board after mounting evidence implicated a campaign operative submitted fraudulent absentee ballots. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s become clear to me the public&#x2019;s confidence in the 9th District seat general election has been undermined to an extent that a new election is warranted.&#x201D;
	
	Investigators testified on Monday, February 18 that a &#x201C;coordinated, unlawful and substantially sourced absentee ballot scheme operated during the 2018 general election in Bladen and Robeson counties.&#x201D; 
	
	The operative in question, Leslie McCrae Dowless, refused to testify at Monday&#x2019;s hearings because the Board would not grant him immunity from self-incrimination.
	
	Andy Yates, cofounder of Dowless&#x2019; employer the Red Dome Group, told the Board Harris specifically requested Dowless to run his &#x201C;get-out-the-vote operations&#x201D; in Bladen County.
	
	Dowless received all Harris campaign payments via the Red Dome Group. They paid Dowless $1,200 monthly during the primary election (Harris won by 828 votes, 437 of those mail-in), and $1,625 monthly during the general election. 
	
	During the many hours of Yates&#x2019; testimony, he explained that Dowless personally spoke to Mark Harris on the phone, referring to &#x201C;frequent conversations&#x201D; the two had on a near daily basis. Red Dome, according to Yates, gave little oversight to Dowless.
	
	Yates said numerous times Dowless &#x201C;told me at no time were his folks ever to touch, handle, put their hands on, collect, [or] mail an absentee ballot.
	
	&#x201C;And [that] he knew that was illegal, that he made sure all of his folks knew that was illegal,&#x201D; Yates added.
	
	Yates said he was doubting Dowless&#x2019; honesty after state investigators revealed at the hearing that Dowless paid for absentee ballots, held ballots at his home and asked members of his staff to sign ballots as witnesses falsely. This creates opportunity for voting fraud. By law, absentee ballots are supposed to be witnessed by two people at the time the voter fills out the ballot.
	
	&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know what to believe about McCrae Dowless. I don&#x2019;t know whether or not to believe anything Mr. Dowless ever told me,&#x201D; Yates testified on Monday.
	
	Dramatic testimony came from assistant US attorney in the Eastern District of North Carolina John Harris, Mark Harris&#x2019; son. He claims he warned his father about Dowless&#x2019; shady reputation before hiring him, specifically his role working for a primary opponent in the 2016 midterm elections. Though that opponent, Todd Johnson, came in third place overall, he received 221 mail-in votes to Harris&#x2019; four and primary winner Representative Robert Pittenger&#x2019;s one.
	
	Dowless  was convicted of felony insurance fraud in 1992 along with his wife, after taking out a policy on a dead man and collecting $165,000.  He was sentenced to a two-year jail term, but served just six months. 
	
	&#x201C;I thought what he [Dowless] was doing was illegal, and I was right,&#x201D; John said at the hearing.
	
	&#x201C;I had no reason to believe that my father actually knew, or my mother or any other associate with the campaign had any knowledge,&#x201D; John continued. &#x201C;I think Dowless told them he wasn&#x2019;t doing any of this, and they believed him.&#x201D;</body>

    <title>Red Dome Operative Dowless Indicted, Arrested in 9th District Election Investigation</title>
    <subhead></subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>RALEIGH &#x2014; The political operative and alleged absentee-ballot fixer at the center of the North Carolina 9th Congressional District election fraud scandal, Leslie McCrae Dowless, was arrested on Wednesday, February 27, following a grand jury indictment for felony obstruction of justice, conspiracy to obstruct justice and for the unlawful possession of absentee ballots.
	
	Dowless was taken into custody early Wednesday morning, according to the office of Wake County District Attorney Lorrin Freeman, under a $30,000 bond. Dowless was also instructed to break contact with all alleged co-conspirators named the indictment.
	
	The indictment accuses Dowless of submitting absentee ballots and container-return envelopes for those ballots to the Bladen County Board of Elections &#x201C;in such a manner to so as to make it appear that those ballots had been voted and executed in compliance&#x201D; with current regulations laid out in the state&#x2019;s General Statutes, &#x201C;when in fact they had not.
	
	&#x201C;As a result,&#x201D; the signed indictment continued, &#x201C;these spoiled absentee ballots were counted by the local Board of Election and the total tally forwarded to the State Board of Elections...resulting in the counting of spoiled absentee ballots that had not been executed in compliance with state law.&#x201D;
	
	Dowless was employed by GOP congressional candidate Mark Harris through the political consulting firm known as Red Dome Group. On election day, Harris appeared victorious by a gap of only 905 votes; although official certification did not follow once evidence of Dowless&#x2019; alleged ballot-tampering scheme came to light.
	
	After three days of tumultuous hearings, the state board found the evidence in favor of fraud so compelling that they unanimously chose &lt;a href="https://piedmontsundial.com/calendar/calendar_main_article.php?theArticle=232" target="_blank"&gt;to order a new election&lt;/a&gt; .
	
	Harris told media on Tuesday, February 26 that his name will not be on the new ballot and instead endorsed Stony Rushing, a Union County Commissioner. Rushing, a father of two, has an animal agriculture background and owns the Take Aim Training Range, a shooting range.
	
	According to Freeman&#x2019;s office the investigation into criminal misconduct is considered &#x201C;ongoing,&#x201D; and that within a month the State Bureau of Investigation will have received the bulk of the elections board&#x2019;s evidentiary findings. 
	
	The indictment also includes charges related to Dowless&#x2019; work on State Senator Todd Johnson&#x2019;s campaign during the primary contest leading up to the 2016 general election. Johnson ultimately lost the primary, coming in third, but claimed an unusually high number of absentee votes: 221 out of a total of 226 submitted.
	
	Harris testified that Dowless&#x2019; absentee ballot efforts for Johnson were so impressive that he decided to hire the operative for his 2018 campaign. </body>

    <title>ICE: Targeted Immigration Arrests in NC Communities Will Continue 	</title>
    <subhead>"We will not turn a blind eye," ICE officer says</subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>Hundreds of people were arrested in early 2019 during federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids across central North Carolina, following action taken by area law enforcement agencies to cease extending to ICE the access needed to arrest undocumented immigrants at local jails.
	
	Many of the arrests in 2019 have come during a fast-and-furious one-week period between February 3 and February 7. The wave of targeted arrests is not a retaliation, ICE representatives stated, but an outgrowth of the agency's regular activity away from the jails where many arrests took place until recently.
	
	Targeted arrests to pick up undocumented people at residences, workplaces, and in public places constitutes the &#x201C;new normal,&#x201D; said Bryan Cox, director of the Office of Public Affairs for ICE Southern Region.
	
	&#x201C;Local agencies have evicted ICE from local law enforcement,&#x201D; said ICE Public Affairs Officer Carissa Cutrell, &#x201C;and said, 'We will not tell you who is in our jails.&#x2019;&#x201D;
	
	Municipal law enforcement agencies in the Triangle have indeed stated that they will no longer alert ICE when they have an individual wanted by ICE in their jails.&amp;nbsp;
	
	They have ceased to respond to &#x201C;detainer requests&#x201D; sent by ICE, which, when honored, enabled ICE investigators to arrest individuals held at local jails past the point when they would otherwise be released &#x2014; for example, by posting bond &#x2014; so that ICE could assume custody.
	
	North  Carolina&#x2019;s two largest counties, Wake and Mecklenburg, no longer work with ICE through a program that delegates authority for immigration enforcement (the 287(g) program, established in the Immigration and Nationality Act), not since new sheriffs took over after ousting incumbents in November 2018 elections. Orange and Durham counties have not been participating, either. In December, Durham County&#x2019;s new Sheriff Clarence Birkhead pledged not to honor detainer requests. 
	
	Asked whether targeted raids were conducted in retaliation for local authorities&#x2019; denial of access to county jails, an ICE spokesman said they were not.
	
	&#x201C;Until recently, ICE simply went to the jail and picked them up upon release,&#x201D; said Cox. &#x201C;When they are released from custody they &#x2014; the criminal offender &#x2014; can offend again. So, if local law enforcement does not cooperate with ICE, the ICE agents have no choice but to go out into the community and find these individuals.&#x201D; 
	
	ICE&#x2019;s Southern Region is responsible for enforcement of immigration laws in nine states and Puerto Rico. In North Carolina, an estimated 350,000 of the state&#x2019;s immigrants are undocumented. That figure comprised 43 percent of the state&#x2019;s immigrant population and 3.4 percent of the state&#x2019;s total population in 2014, according to the American Immigration Council.
	
	According to Cox, the visibility of recent arrests, many of which have occurred in public spaces (including areas outside of arrestees&#x2019; schools, churches and workplaces) was a practical result of agents conducting arrests of the individuals away from county jails.
	
	&#x201C;A common complaint by protesters is random indiscriminate law enforcement,&#x201D; said Cox, from the tri-state headquarters in Georgia, &#x201C;But that is not what ICE does. ICE only conducts targeted arrests.&#x201D;
	
	The Georgia office oversees ICE activity North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia. Neither of the Carolinas has an ICE detention center; therefore, all detainees are sent to Georgia.
	
	&#x201C;In the 2018 fiscal year, we made 15,000 arrests in the three-state area,&#x201D; Cox said. &#x201C;With 52 weeks in a year that is just a little under 300 arrests a week. Ninety-one percent of all of those arrested by ICE had a criminal record or pending criminal charge."
	
	&#x201C;ICE is more visible now because they are out in the community. When we are in the streets and are seeking out a released person, we will still find the target, but if we encounter persons that are also in the country unlawfully,&#x201D; said Cox, &#x201C;we will not turn a blind eye.&#x201D;
	
	&lt;b&gt;Local Resistance&lt;/b&gt;
	
	Sheriffs&#x2019;  departments in Mecklenburg, Durham, Wake and Orange counties have all ceased honoring ICE retainers.
	
	Durham and Orange have a longer history of not participating in the 287(g) program. (The program is named for the Delegation of Immigration Authority section of the Immigration and Nationality Act, a section added in 1996.)
	
	&#x201C;Orange County has never been a participant in the 287(g) Program,&#x201D; said Sheriff Charles Blackwood of Orange County. &#x201C;Our position is and continues to be that if we receive documentation that provides the necessary legal basis to satisfy the Fourth Amendment, we will hold the individual. Absent the necessary legal basis, the individual will be released.&#x201D;
	
	ICE, in its 2018 annual report, said their increase in detainers &#x201C;shows a consistent focus on interior enforcement&#x2026;despite continued opposition and lack of cooperation from uncooperative jurisdictions.&#x201D;
	
	Blackwood said, &#x201C;It&#x2019;s not accurate to say that we don't &#x2018;cooperate&#x2019; with ICE; that would suggest we are uncooperative. That is not the case. We simply don&#x2019;t honor detainers that are not signed by a judge.&#x201D;
	
	Whether or not illegal aliens have any or partial claim to the U.S. Constitution&#x2019;s protections for American citizens is still under intense debate across the nation.
	
	In 2015, the North Carolina General Assembly made sanctuary cities in North Carolina illegal, but the majority of public opinion among city dwellers in both the Triangle and Charlotte swings in the opposite direction.
	
	ICE is also encountering resistance from local churches and other protesters as they venture out into the community. This has included protests but also interference in arrests.
	
	One such instance resulted in the arrests of 27 church and community members. In Durham last November, 47-year-old Samuel Oliver-Bruno, an undocumented immigrant, left the sanctuary at CityWell United Methodist Church to go to an appointment with Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) in Morrisville. There, Oliver-Bruno was arrested and taken into custody by ICE.
	
	Nearly 100 individuals, mostly CityWell United Methodist Church members, who had come to support Oliver-Bruno, rushed and then surrounded the ICE vehicle taking him, singing &#x201C;Amazing Grace&#x201D; and temporarily blocking the way. Due to the incident, 27 were arrested, including Oliver-Bruno&#x2019;s son.
	
	U.S. Congressmen David Price and G. K. Butterfield wrote a formal letter on behalf of Oliver-Bruno to the USCIS, requesting &#x201C;prosecutorial discretion in his case based on humanitarian consideration.&#x201D;
	
	Multiple counties across the state have been impacted by similar stories of community members during the recent spate of ICE arrests. Orange, Chatham, Lee, Randolph, and several others have also found ICE more active in their communities.
	
	In early February, it was reported that 27 people were arrested by ICE in Sanford at a gun manufacturing plant. ICE said the arrests were the result of an ongoing investigation involving identity theft and fraud. The manufacturing company, Bear Creek Arsenal, was cleared by ICE of any wrongdoing.
	
	&#x201C;This last week has been overwhelming for our community. The separation of families, and the panic,&#x201D; read a February 11 press release by Pilar Rocha-Goldberg, president and CEO of El Centro Hispano (The Hispanic Center), and Ilana Dubester, executive director of the Hispanic Liaison. 
	
	The two groups have joined forces to further aid the undocumented Hispanic community. El Centro operates in the Triangle, and the Liaison around rural central North Carolina, including Chatham, Alamance, Randolph and Lee counties.
	
	The two groups stated, &#x201C;In response to the ICE and H.S.I. [Homeland Security Investigations] raids conducted last week in Lee, Durham and many other counties across North Carolina, El Centro Hispano and The Hispanic Liaison have joined forces to create a &#x2018;Liberation Not Deportation Regional Fund.&#x2019; This regional fund will help pay for legal representation fees for families impacted.&#x201D;
	
	&lt;b&gt;A &#x201C;New Normal &#x201D;&lt;/b&gt;
	
	&#x201C;We will not honor an ICE detainer,&#x201D; said Jennifer Galassi, Orange County Sheriff's legal adviser. &#x201C;We simply will not honor an ICE detainer or warrant that is issued without probable cause. It is a violation of the Fourth Amendment.&#x201D;
	
	ICE activity picked up under the Obama administration; in the fiscal year 2012, 409,849 people were removed, almost 160 percent greater than the fiscal year of 2018 (federal fiscal years run from October 1 to September 30; in this case, October 1, 2017 to September 30, 2018). Of that group, 1,215 were convicted of homicide, 5,557 were convicted of sexual offenses, 44,653 were convicted of drug-related crime and 35,927 were convicted of driving under the influence.
	
	This last fiscal year was the highest year for administrative arrests (the arrest of an alien for a civil violation of U.S. immigration laws for a case that gets adjudicated) since fiscal year 2014. ICE&#x2019;s 2018 annual report says the increase in arrests and removals in this year from last is because &#x201C;ICE does not exempt classes or categories of removable aliens from potential enforcement,&#x201D; as directed by President Trump&#x2019;s executive order in January 2017, &#x201C;Enhancing Public Safety in the Interior of the United States&#x201D;.
	
	Administrative arrests in fiscal year 2018 increased by 10.5 percent over the prior fiscal year, to a total of 158,581. Of those arrests, 66 percent were of convicted criminals, and 21 percent had pending criminal charges. 
	
	Of the approximately 200 recent immigration arrests, ICE stated that about 50 had criminal convictions, 40 were facing pending criminal charges, and 50 had already been ordered removed from the country. Sixty, the greatest portion, were &#x201C;at-large&#x201D; arrests of people encountered by ICE agents while carrying out targeted enforcement aimed at taking other people into custody.
	
	ICE&#x2019;s 2017 annual report states, &#x201C;ICE is also on the front lines of the fight against illegal narcotics trafficking that is contributing to the country&#x2019;s deadly opioid epidemic. Its special agents seized approximately 7,000 pounds of heroin and more than 2,300 pounds of fentanyl, a drug so deadly, just a few grams can be lethal.&#x201D; 
	
	&#x201C;The people we arrest have violated the country's immigration laws and often have previous criminal records, and that is why we have to prioritize them,&#x201D; said Cutrell.</body>

    <title>School Board Chair Resigns Amid Recall Campaign</title>
    <subhead>Two CHCCS Board Members Remain in Effort's Crosshairs</subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>&#xD;

		&#xD;

			CHAPEL HILL &#x2014; Margaret Samuels, who resigned as chair of Chapel Hill&#x2013;Carrboro City Schools (CHCCS) Board of Education last week, issued a statement announcing her resignation on the morning of Tuesday, March 5, citing blowback from a controversy that began with the board&#x2019;s vote in September 2018 to convert Glenwood Elementary School into a dual-language Mandarin-English magnet school.
	
	 &#x201C;The charges leveled at me are baseless and without foundation,&#x201D; Samuels wrote in her statement. &#x201C;However, I have no desire to be a part of anything that takes the focus away from our students. When the behavior of adults is the leading story in any school district &#x2014; we know we have a problem.&#x201D;
	
	Throughout January and February 2019, three members of the board &#x2014; Samuels, Pat Heinrich and James Barrett &#x2014; have been the subject of a recall campaign over alleged violations of the Board of Education&#x2019;s policy code. 
	
	A petition on the campaign&#x2019;s website, &lt;a href="https://boardrecallcom.wordpress.com/" target="_blank"&gt;boardrecall.com,&lt;/a&gt; is currently collecting signatures  to get a recall. The site&#x2019;s authors claim to speak for &#x201C;a group of Chapel Hill and Carrboro parents and citizens.&#x201D;  
	
	The website and recall campaign accused Samuels, Heinrich and Barrett of unprofessional and unwarranted conduct.
	
	According to parents involved in the campaign, the improper contact predates a vote last September when the board voted 4-3 to make Glenwood Elementary a dual-language magnet school specializing in Mandarin Chinese
	
	Samuels, Heinrich and Barrett voted for the conversion in September, along with Amy Fowler; board members Rani Dasi, Joal Hall Broun and Mary Ann Wolf voted against the proposal. 
	
	The recall campaign&#x2019;s website and accompanying brochure accuse Heinrich and Barrett of &#x201C;coordinating with the Mandarin Dual Language community and disclosing non-public Board of Education information to advance their special interests.&#x201D; It says Samuels failed in her &#x201C;duty to enforce and commit to policy codes that govern CHCCS Board members.&#x201D;
	
	The changeover was intended to begin fall of 2019, with enrollment being limited to students who are in the dual-language track of studies and who are selected by lottery to attend. Traditional-track students, those not studying Mandarin, would move to other schools, theoretically reducing overcrowding at Glenwood.
	
	Of note is that the school system estimated this switch would drop enrollment of African-American and Latino students at Glenwood to below 20 percent, combined, of the student population there.
	
	In  December, the Board of Education voted to do as CHCCS administration requested and delay changing Glenwood to a dual-language magnet school until fall of 2020. The board also began consideration of ways to keep some traditional-track students at the school, expecting to vote this spring.
	
	 
	
	Shortly after the September vote, a group of parents with children enrolled in Glenwood&#x2019;s traditional elementary track began criticizing Heinrich and Barrett&#x2019;s communications with parents before the vote. Through use of public records requests just after the vote in September, copies of emails and text message communications between board members and the Mandarin magnet advocates were made available to the public on November 29. 
	
	&#x201C;These actions [against myself and other board members] have been provoked because a program for children was expanded,&#x201D; Samuels&#x2019; press release read. &#x201C;The expansion of this program was approved through a democratic process and by a majority board vote.
	
	&#x201C;The  board&#x2019;s legal counsel advised that there was no conflict of interest regarding the issues raised in this vote,&#x201D; the statement continued. &#x201C;Nevertheless, since being elected chair, well after the events in question occurred, I have tried to respond to public concerns.&#x201D; 
	
	 
	
	Riza Redd, the media contact for the recall campaign , told the Sundial, &#x201C;When you think about the grand scheme of politics, we have these codes of conduct for elected officials in place to ensure that, no matter what side you support on a particular issue...all parties have the equal ability to lobby their board members.
	
	&#x201C;You don&#x2019;t want a situation where some groups are getting unfair access,&#x201D; she added.
	
	According to Redd, Heinrich and Barrett engaged in improper communication with members of the public to advance support of the dual-language effort.
	
	Members of the recall effort allege violations of Board of Education policy that include disclosing the private information of school staff and the content of closed-door board meetings, a potential violation of the North Carolina School Boards Association&#x2019;s &lt;a href="https://www.ncsba.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/2120.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;code of ethics&lt;/a&gt;  requiring, among other things, &#x201C;the need to uphold the integrity and independence of the board member&#x2019;s office&#x201D; and &#x201C;the need to conduct the affairs of the board in an open and public manner.&#x201D;
	
	A recall campaign must submit a petition of signatures from 10 percent of registered voters in each member&#x2019;s district (roughly 7000 signatures per board member). The election must be held 50 to 70 days after the petition is certified. This is according to the 1993 NC General Assembly&#x2019;s Senate Bill 1682, which made amendments to government of Orange and Chatham counties.
	
	The recall campaign published  screenshots on its website  of the communications in question, which include smartphone text messages as well as the emails mentioned above.
	
	For example, in what appears to be an email to the contact for the Mandarin Advisory Committee, a committee of volunteering parents whose children are in the Mandarin dual language program, Heinrich named a Glenwood teacher and a retired teacher who wrote against the magnet program and summarized the letters. 
	
	The email screenshot is presented on the recall effort&#x2019;s website. Heinrich also wrote, &#x201C;If there are teachers that would be willing to write to the board in favor of Mandarin, that would probably be helpful.&#x201D;&lt;div class="calendarArticlePhotoBox" id="CalendarArticlePhotoBox-90/"&gt;&#xD;
		&#xD;
		&#xD;
		&#xD;
					In a text message screenshot presented on the &lt;a href="https://www.boardrecall.com " target="_blank"&gt;website,&lt;/a&gt; Barrett advised a parent in support of the Mandarin magnet program to &#x201C;[reach] out to board members to see if the votes are there.&#x201D; He additionally states, &#x201C;Amy [Fowler] is whom I worry about if anyone.&#x201D;&lt;div class="calendarArticlePhotoBox" id="CalendarArticlePhotoBox-92//"&gt;&#xD;
		&#xD;
		&#xD;
		&#xD;
					The parent, after hearing from Fowler that she supported the initiative, then wrote to Barrett, &#x201C;This is probably something I don&#x2019;t have to say to you, but please don&#x2019;t mention to her [Fowler] that you know we communicated with her.&#x201D; Barret then assures the parent that Samuels is &#x201C;definite&#x201D; as a vote.&lt;div class="calendarArticlePhotoBox" id="CalendarArticlePhotoBox-94///"&gt;&#xD;
		&#xD;
		&#xD;
		&#xD;
					In another email presented on the recall campaign&#x2019;s website, Heinrich writes, &#x201C;If the room [in a public Board meeting] is 80% traditional track parents because our parents didn&#x2019;t show up, it makes it harder for the uncommitted swing voters on the board to vote our way.&#x201D; (See below.) &lt;div class="calendarArticlePhotoBox" id="CalendarArticlePhotoBox-93"&gt;&#xD;
		&#xD;
		&#xD;
		&#xD;
		&#xD;
					The recall effort alleges that the two members and the former chair committed violations of Board of Education policy, including the requirement to conduct board affairs in a transparent fashion, to follow applicable statutes that govern open meetings, to treat privileged information in a confidential manner and to not use one&#x2019;s board membership for personal or partisan gain.
	
	Heinrich and Barrett have been cleared of any conflict of interest by the Board of Education&#x2019;s legal counsel, meaning that accountability for a policy violation would consist of professional sanctions or a recall only , and could not be brought to civil court. 
	
	As Heinrich is the father of a Glenwood student, he is protected by an additional Board of Education policy allowing members to place the interests of their own children above their duties to the board.
	
	Ron DiFelice, a Glenwood parent, confronted Board of Education members at a public hearing on transparency issues, and told them that, upon examination of the emails and additional text messages, it was clear that seven board policies had been violated.
	
	A recall vote would be decided by the general public within the district.  The legal counsel&#x2019;s clearing Barrett and Heinrich would not be relevant to a recall vote. Samuels, having resigned, would not be subject to a recall.
	
	Though Samuels resigned, Heinrich and Barrett remain &#x2014; at least till November, when their seats are up for a vote.
	
	Barrett will not be running again. He has announced that he will run for statewide election in 2020 as Superintendent of Public Instruction.
	
	Barrett is the only current board member who was serving in 2012 when the CHCCS Board of Education voted 5-1 to approve a controversial dual-language proposal to convert Frank Porter Graham Elementary School as part of a general redistricting plan.  FPG was converted from a neighborhood elementary school into a magnet school for Spanish-English dual language education for the 2013&#x2013;2014 school year. The board voted in 2012 to approve the change even in the face of spirited public objection from current and former FPG parents. 
	
	 
	
	Redemption is possible for Heinrich and Barrett, Redd said, if they are willing to publicly admit wrongdoing.  
	
	Redd said, &#x201C;There needs to be some accountability for the actions of these board members.&#x201D; 
	
	The Sundial reached out to Heinrich and Barrett for comment, but had not received a reply from either member at the time of publication.&#xD;

    <title>Fuquay-Varina Homicide, Eight Years Cold, May Break Open</title>
    <subhead></subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>FUQUAY-VARINA &#x2014; Investigators assigned to the 2011 cold case of the death of 41-year-old Sandra Denise Thomas are pursuing a new lead that may implicate an Apex resident in a decades-old cold case. 
	
	 
	
	Thomas&#x2019;s body was discovered on Lawrence Street in a ditch on March 29, 2011. She had extensive injuries that led the police to speculate that she may have been struck by a motor vehicle. The body was partially nude, adding further mystery to the circumstances of her death. 
	
	Thomas left a party at a private residence on West Street around 2 AM the same night, which was the last time she was seen alive. 
	
	&#x201C;Even though the case went cold, investigators have not given up,&#x201D; said an &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/fvpolice/posts/2030015290636557?__tn__=K-R" target="_blank"&gt;official statement&lt;/a&gt; posted last week on the Fuquay-Varina Police Department Facebook page. &#x201C;Last week, our investigative team with the assistance of CCBI [City-County Bureau of Investigation] collected evidence as part of our renewed focus.&#x201D;
	
	A &#x201C;cocoon of silence&#x201D; enveloped circumstances around Thomas&#x2019;s death after initial investigation, the department&#x2019;s press release stated.
	
	The Sundial reached the Fuquay-Varina Police Department and was informed by a public information officer that the department was not presently releasing any information that was not in the press release.
	
	The press release indicates that new evidence has been collected by municipal police with assistance from CCBI, an independent organization established by the North Carolina General Assembly in 1937 that operates in Wake County and specializes in collecting forensic evidence it then turns over to other law enforcement agencies for analysis.
	
	Earlier this month, a search warrant allowing investigators to examine the home and truck of an unnamed individual living in Apex was approved. The full scope of the investigation has not been made public.
	
	&#x201C;We still have more work to do and it is not appropriate at this time to show all of our cards publicly as to the investigation,&#x201D; the statement read. &#x201C;Someone knows something about this case, and it is time to come forward.&#x201D;
	
	The Sundial reached out to the Apex police department&#x2019;s public information officer, who said that he was unaware of the case, but explained that proper procedure for extending an investigation outside their normal jurisdiction requires only cursory communication. 
	
	&#x201C;Our policy is that they [outside investigators] notify us, but they would do the investigation,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;If they needed something from us, like they needed us to help them locate someone, we would do that...and that&#x2019;s pretty standard across the United States.&#x201D; 
	
	To link the suspect to Thomas&#x2019;s death with physical evidence, the police may need to find her DNA on the suspect&#x2019;s property; for example on a vehicle. Since the incident occurred eight years ago, even if the evidence was there, collection and analysis may prove more difficult. 
	
	Regardless, investigators are determined to solve the case. 
	
	 &#x201C;We may not solve the case today,&#x201D; the Facebook statement continued, &#x201C;but we will never give up. Sandra deserves justice.&#x201D;</body>

    <title>Duke to Pay $112 Million in False Research Settlement</title>
    <subhead>US Govt and Duke whistleblower share big payout</subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>DURHAM &#x2014; Duke University  has agreed to pay a total of $112.5 million in an out-of-court settlement to the United States government and a former staff member who blew the whistle on fraudulent data being used to secure federal research grants for Duke research. 
	
	According to a March 25 statement from the U.S. Department of Justice, Duke University &#x201C;knowingly submitted and caused to be submitted claims to the NIH and to the EPA that contained falsified or fabricated data or statements in thirty (30) grants, causing the NIH and EPA to pay out grants funds they otherwise would not have.&#x201D;
	
	At the heart of the lawsuit is the work of a former Duke researcher, Erin Potts-Kant. Potts-Kant mostly researched the lung function of mice under different chemical exposures, contributing to larger research on pollutants&#x2019; effects on bodies&#x2019; airways. The false information was used to win grants from both the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
	
	The lawsuit was filed by an individual, Joseph Thomas. Thomas&#x2019; suit, filed in 2013,  claimed that a prominent campus researcher falsified data and that Duke covered it up after discovering the falsehood, which both university and researcher have admitted occurred.
	
	Thomas, a Duke lab analyst, will receive $33.75 million of the settlement for his role as a &#x201C;relator&#x201D;: a private person who files a suit on behalf of the government when the federal False Claims Act (FCA) is violated. 
	
	The suit identified Erin Potts-Kant, who was employed as a researcher for eight years (2005 to March 2013) before she was placed on administrative leave and then being fired for embezzling from the university, a charge not included in the legal proceedings that resulted in the settlement. 
	
	During her tenure, Potts-Kant &#x201C;fabricated and/or falsified &#x2018;nearly all&#x2019; of her grant-funded flexiVent and multiplex experiments, making the results &#x2018;better,&#x2019;&#x201D; legal filings associated with the lawsuit say. 
	
	Court documents further note, &#x201C;As a condition of [receiving federal] funding, Duke agreed to be &#x2018;fully accountable&#x2019; to the federal government for the use of grant funds, and &#x2018;responsible for the actions of its employees.&#x2019;&#x201D;
	
	In 2013, Thomas and his legal team first filed a lawsuit under seal (i.e. unavailable to the public &#x2014; a requirement of the Federal Claims Act), in which they noted that Potts-Kant, as the pulmonary division's former clinical research coordinator, needed to certify the totality of her unit's work to ensure it satisfied all government requirements. 
	
	"Potts-Kant engaged in systematic and near-universal research fraud," according to the lawsuit. &#x201C;In lieu of actually performing experiments," Potts-Kant went as far as to fabricate data.
	
	&#x201C;In many meritorious cases, the government decides to &#x2018;intervene&#x2019; at [the initial] stage of the proceedings, basically taking over the lead of the case.&#x201D; Thomas&#x2019; attorneys wrote in a statement posted to official website of the law firm Gentry Locke Associates. &#x201C;But here, that never happened. This left Mr. Thomas and his lawyers at the point of the spear &#x2014; going against a venerated academic institution with enormous resources.&#x201D; 
	
	Under the rules of lawsuits brought by private individuals on behalf of the U.S. Government, the relator (the person filing the suit) still cannot settle the suit, as Thomas did, without the government&#x2019;s permission.
	
	&#x201C;The investigation and settlement in this matter were the result of a coordinated effort by&#x201D; the Justice Department&#x2019;s Civil Division&#x2019;s Commercial Litigation Branch, U.S. Attorneys&#x2019; offices for the Middle District of North Carolina and the Western District of Virginia, the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General, and the EPA Office of Inspector General, according to the statement.
	
	In a civil action brief filed in August of 2018, Thomas and his team claimed that Potts-Kant was falsifying her research results mere months into her short tenure. In 2016 the university drafted her an admission of guilt, which she signed, although its text is redacted in available court documents.  
	
	Potts-Kant not only used the fake data to fraudulently obtain grant money, but in some cases had the information published in academic journals. A scholarly database search lists her as the coauthor of at least 38 articles in academic journals alongside other Duke scientists, some of which were later cited by researchers conducting separate experiments.
	
	The academic watchdog organization RetractionWatch.com currently lists 17 retracted articles or papers bearing some relationship to the fabricated data within Potts-Kant&#x2019;s tainted research.
	
	The American Journal of Physiology &#x2013; Lung Cellular and Molecular Physiology published its retraction notice for one such article, &#x201C;MARCKS-related peptide modulates in vivo the secretion of airway Muc5ac&#x201D; in August of 2018.
	
	In an official statement sent to students and faculty, Duke President Vincent E. Price wrote that any college department that fails &#x201C;to uphold [research] standards...must accept responsibility, acknowledge that our processes for identifying and preventing misconduct did not work, and take steps to improve.
	
	"This is a difficult moment for Duke,&#x201D; he added. </body>

    <title>Two Arrested for Racist Vandalism on UNC Campus</title>
    <subhead></subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>CHAPEL HILL &#x2014; A little more than two weeks after a March 16 incident in which a cofounder of the group Heirs to the Confederacy brought a handgun onto the University of North Carolina campus, a monument to &#x201C;people of color&#x201D; who helped build the university and a piece of publicly displayed art were vandalized.&amp;nbsp;
	
	Nancy Rushton McCorkle and Ryan  Barnett were charged on April 8 with defacing the items and &#x201C;ethnic intimidation,&#x201D; a Class 1 misdemeanor in North Carolina.
	
	On Sunday, March 31, &#x201C;two individuals defaced the Unsung Founders Memorial, writing racist and other deplorable language on it,&#x201D; Interim Chancellor Kevin M. Guskiewicz wrote in an email sent to students and faculty.
	
	&#x201C;University Police contacted the facilities department, and the Memorial was cleaned,&#x201D; Guskiewicz&#x2019;s email continued.
	
	The Unsung Founders Memorial, a gift by the university&#x2019;s class of 2002, honors &#x201C;the University&#x2019;s unsung founders &#x2014; the people of color bond and free &#x2014; who helped build the Carolina that we cherish today.&#x201D; Its appearance is like that of a table supported by many miniature human figures, with five seats around it.&amp;nbsp;
	
	The chancellor&#x2019;s email went on to describe a separate incident in which &#x201C;university Police discovered that an installation outside Hanes Art Center was also vandalized with hateful language and racial slurs today. 
	
	&#x201C;The McCorkle Place incident was found by an on-duty police officer, and the Hanes Art Center incident was reported to an on-duty police officer by a passing motorist.&#x201D;
	
	Campus police were initially reticent when pressed for details of the ongoing investigation, stating only that two suspects had been filmed on surveillance cameras and that arrest warrants had been issued for both. 
	
	On Monday, April 8, Young sent the Sundial two mugshots and an arrest report identifying Nancy Rushton McCorkle and Ryan Barnett, who were both taken into custody that day. According to court calendars available online from the North Carolina Judicial Branch, McCorkle and Barnett are each charged with &#x201C;damage to real property&#x201D; and &#x201C;ethnic intimidation.&#x201D; Barnett was also charged with &#x201C;public urination.&#x201D;
	
	Barnett is scheduled to appear in court on April 22, McCorkle on April 25, both in the Orange County Courthouse in Hillsborough.
	
	Campus officials  said before arrests were made that at least one suspect had ties to the Heirs to the Confederacy. The New York Times &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/08/us/heirs-confederacy-unc-memorial.html" target="_blank"&gt;wrote &lt;/a&gt; that both arrested were members of Heirs to the Confederacy, according to its cofounder Lance Spivey. A Nancy Rushton whose profile pictures resemble the Nancy Rushton McCorkle in the mugshot is publicly listed as an administrator (one of 17) on the Heirs to the Confederacy Facebook page.
	
	According to a statement Spivey &lt;a href="https://www.heraldsun.com/news/local/article228703289.html" target="_blank"&gt;gave &lt;/a&gt; to The Durham Herald-Sun on April 1, prior to the arrests, &#x201C;I, and Heirs to the Confederacy as a whole, will have no part in the damaging, desecration, or destruction of any historical monument, memorial, or marker, and actually support the protection of all such monuments, be they Confederate or otherwise.&#x201D; If members did vandalize the property, they acted &#x201C;in a renegade capacity.&#x201D;
	
	Two weeks earlier, on March 16, Spivey openly carried a firearm near or perhaps even onto the campus while accompanied by other Heirs members.
	
	The Heirs to the Confederacy had at the time several members, though not representing the group officially, demonstrating on campus and in town. After coming on campus &#x201C;via Raleigh Street to Cameron Avenue,&#x201D; they were &#x201C;approached by UNC Police officers on the sidewalk in front of Memorial Hall and were asked to leave campus, which they did,&#x201D; according to a &lt;a href="https://uncnews.unc.edu/2019/03/18/university-statement-on-events-of-saturday-march-16/" target="_blank"&gt;statement &lt;/a&gt; released by UNC-Chapel Hill&#x2019;s Communications Office. 
	
	No arrests were made for the March 16 incident.
	
	The incident was witnessed and photographed, and rumors both online and word of mouth spread rapidly around the campus and the town, which have in the past year experienced tumult around the illegal toppling of the Confederate memorial monument Silent Sam on the north campus.&amp;nbsp;
	
	The Unsung Founders Memorial is not far from the spot where Silent Sam, which protestors toppled on Aug. 20, 2018. The statue's pedestal was subsequently removed by order of then-chancellor Carol Folt.&lt;br&gt;
	
	UNC-Chapel Hill&#x2019;s statement was issued to clarify March 16 events.
	
	UNC Media Relations Manager Randy Young wrote by email to the Sundial that &#x201C;no police incident report for the interaction&#x201D; was filed. 
	
	Spivey wrote  in a March 19 guest &lt;a href="https://federalobserver.com/2019/03/never-surrender-with-the-enemy-at-the-gates/?fbclid=IwAR1IZYIUlaJL88zKElQva0Jqhmb_X5pkhbUi8rVyEKPFkL936CDtld8WhZA" target="_blank"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; called &#x201C;Never Surrender with the Enemy at the Gates&#x201D; on a blog called &#x201C;The Federal Observer&#x201D; that, being an unpermitted gathering, the group wanted to protect themselves from &#x201C;ANTIFA.&#x201D; He wrote, &#x201C;Some of us carried sidearms. I alone of those that carried do not have my Concealed-Carry Permit yet, so I carried my pistol in its holster on my belt in plain view.&#x201D;
	
	He also wrote, in that post and in one on March 12, that the March 16 gathering was originally going to be an official one, with a permit to assemble, but Chapel Hill police requested the event be cancelled out of concern that the force would be spread too thin because of a UNC-Chapel Hill basketball game that night and other events. The group agreed to cancel the official event, but some members still gathered independently, including Spivey.
	
	Open-carry legislation in North Carolina permits firearms in public spaces &#x201C;unless otherwise prohibited&#x201D;, public universities being one of such areas. This could have exposed the demonstrators to criminal charges. 
	
	But, the Communications Office&#x2019;s statement said, &#x201C;due to immediate uncertainty on Saturday about the application of these laws to the Cameron Avenue right of way...no arrest was made in this case.&#x201D;
	
	In the future, the statement says, displaying a firearm will not be tolerated by UNC authorities on any of its campuses. Anyone violating this state statute &#x201C;will be arrested and issued a warning of trespass for the campus.&#x201D;
	
	&#x201C;The University is committed to the safety of our campus community,&#x201D; the statement continues, reminding students and staff that UNC Police will always solicit tips from the public of situations &#x201C;indicating a threat to the campus community from any group.&#x201D;
	
	According to a Carrboro Police Department source close to the Sundial, at least two of their officers were onsite for the gathering, as campus police requested their presence and the two departments have a mutual aid arrangement.
	
	Regarding the vandalism of the art installation and monument, Interim Chancellor Guskiewicz posted a statement on the UNC-Chapel Hill website on March 22, in which he wrote that the &#x201C;disturbing&#x201D; event led to &#x201C;questions about how the event unfolded, the interpretation of state law and what we can learn from this incident.
	
	&#x201C;In the coming weeks, I will meet with a variety of campus groups to hear directly how the community envisions our work to eliminate racism and inequality while promoting equity and inclusion on campus,&#x201D; Guskiewicz wrote.
	
	He also assured students of his impending plan to assemble an &#x201C;assessment team&#x201D; responsible for the review of &#x201C;significant campus police actions&#x201D; and to provide oversight for any emergency or &#x201C;public safety events.&#x201D;
	
	&#x201C;Our University has a history of successfully navigating tough issues,&#x201D; Guskiewicz continued. &#x201C;I am confident that we will come together to foster an inclusive culture in which all members of our community feel safe, like they belong and can flourish.&#x201D;</body>

    <title>Wake Forest Triple Murderer Handed Life Sentence</title>
    <subhead></subhead>
    <subheadTwo></subheadTwo>
    <body>RALEIGH &#x2014; Judge Graham Shirley passed a jury-recommended sentence of life without parole for Wake Forest resident Jonathan Sander, convicted of murdering his former business partner, and that man&#x2019;s wife and his mother in March of 2016. 
	
	The decision was announced on Monday, April 15 after four hours of deliberation, in front of friends and relatives of the victims. 
	
	Sander, who was convicted of first-degree murder, was eligible for the death penalty.
	
	&#x201C;I still cannot understand why you hated my son so much,&#x201D; Salvatore Mazzella, father of Sandy Mazzella, read aloud from his victim impact statement at the sentencing hearing, directing his statement to Sander. &#x201C;It baffles me.&#x201D; 
	
	The narrative laid out by prosecutors during the trial, which ultimately led to a guilty verdict on April 8, was a story of close friends turned enemies. 
	
	Sander and Sandy Mazzella, who were next-door neighbors, had co-owned and operated a landscaping business together for years, but had a meaningful falling out in 2016. Sander&#x2019;s murder trial has revealed that what started as financial difficulties escalated into accusations of infidelity and threats of harm to each other&#x2019;s pets.
	
	The tension ratcheted up significantly when Sandy Mazzella&#x2019;s daughter alleged that she had been molested by Sander, which led to multiple temporary restraining orders instated in February of 2016. Mazzella and his family were unable to convince a judge to make the restraining orders permanent. The orders expired the day before the murders.
	
	For their part, Sander and his wife Lori Botti presented themselves during trial as the actual victims of abuse. Botti testified at the initial trial that the Mazzellas repeatedly verbally harassed them from their driveway, shouting &#x201C;Chester the Molester&#x201D; at her husband for the whole neighborhood to hear. She claims things got so bad that she was considering moving back to her hometown in Pennsylvania. 
	
	&#x201C;We didn&#x2019;t feel safe at home,&#x201D; Lori Botti told the court at the sentencing hearing on Thursday April 11, saying that they had taken up residence at a nearby motel to avoid such confrontations in the days leading up to the attack.
	
	Then on March 25, 2016, Sander burst into the Mazzella home with a shotgun and killed Sandy Mazzella, his wife Stephanie Ann Mazzella and his mother Elaine Toby Mazzella. 
	
	Sander&#x2019;s attorney defended his client during the sentencing hearing by arguing that, when the killings took place, Sander was in the throes of a severe mental health crisis brought on by stress. Sander maintains that he has a hazy memory of his actions.
	
	"This is about whether Jon Sander had a serious mental illness and whether that mental illness contributed to where we are today," defense attorney Damon Chetson told the jury.
	
	"At the time that he committed these offenses,&#x201D; Chetson continued, Sander&#x2019;s thinking was &#x201C;impaired.&#x201D; The defense also claimed Sander was acting irrationally as a result of the consumption of six pints of beer on the day of the homicide. 
	
	&#x201C;My mind just snapped,&#x201D; Sander told investigators, according to the transcription of an interrogation immediately after the incident. &#x201C;A month of being tortured by these people and hearing one lie after another, after another, I just snapped.
	
	"I wanted to kill him so his family would be hurt just like my family.&#x201D;
	
	Prosecutors urged the jury not to believe such excuses. 
	
	"He certainly has bipolar disorder 1, he certainly suffers from panic attacks, but that did not cause what happened," Assistant District Attorney Stacy Newton said at Friday&#x2019;s hearing. 
	
	Judge Shirley directed the jury to evaluate the killings, Sander&#x2019;s motives, the behavior of his neighbors, and the loss the surviving Mazzellas must bear for the rest of their lives to decide on correct punishment. They decided that his life should be spent behind bars, but not taken. Judge Graham Shirley issued the sentence.
	
	"Your actions were selfish and they were cowardly," Judge Shirley said before Sander was escorted out of the courtroom. &#x201C;You will die alone.&#x201D;</body>
